title: Budget Allocation Exploiting Label Correlation between Instances
abstract: 'In this study, we introduce an innovative budget allocation method for
  graph instance annotation in crowdsourcing environments, where both the labels of
  instances and their correlations are unknown and need to be estimated simultaneously.
  We model the budget allocation task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop
  an optimization framework that minimizes the uncertainties associated with instance
  labeling and correlation estimation while adhering to budget constraints. To quantify
  uncertainty, we employ entropy and derive two strategies: OPTUENT-EXP and OPTUENT-OPT.
  Our reward function further considers the impact of a workerâ€™s label on the entire
  graph. We conducted extensive experiments using four real-world graph datasets,
  simulating worker labeling behavior to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can accurately estimate
  correlations between adjacent nodes while significantly reducing labeling costs.
  Moreover, across four real-world datasets, our proposed approach consistently outperforms
  existing baselines in moderate and high budget scenarios, highlighting its robustness
  and practical scalability.'
