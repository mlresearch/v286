title: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models through Semantic
  Graph Density
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language understanding but are susceptible
  to "confabulation," where they generate arbitrary, factually incorrect responses
  to uncertain questions. Detecting confabulation in question answering often relies
  on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), which measures semantic entropy or consistency
  among sampled answers. While several methods have been proposed for UQ in LLMs,
  they suffer from key limitations, such as overlooking fine-grained semantic relationships
  among answers and neglecting answer probabilities. To address these issues, we propose
  Semantic Graph Density (SGD). SGD quantifies semantic consistency by evaluating
  the density of a semantic graph that captures fine-grained semantic relationships
  among answers. Additionally, it integrates answer probabilities to adjust the contribution
  of each edge to the overall uncertainty score. We theoretically prove that SGD generalizes
  the previous state-of-the-art method, Deg, and empirically demonstrate its superior
  performance across four LLMs and four free-form question-answering datasets. In
  particular, in experiments with Llama3.1-8B, SGD outperformed the best baseline
  by 1.52% in AUROC on the CoQA dataset and by 1.22% in AUARC on the TriviaQA dataset.
