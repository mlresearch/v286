title: 'Creative Agents: Empowering Agents with Imagination for Creative Tasks'
abstract: We study building embodied agents for open-ended creative tasks. While existing
  methods build instruction-following agents that can perform diverse open-ended tasks,
  none of them demonstrates creativity â€“ the ability to give novel and diverse solutions
  implicit in the language instructions. This limitation comes from their inability
  to convert abstract language instructions into concrete goals and perform long-horizon
  planning for such complicated goals. Given the observation that humans perform creative
  tasks with imagination, we propose a class of solutions, where the controller is
  enhanced with an imaginator generating detailed imaginations of task outcomes conditioned
  on language instructions. We introduce several approaches to implementing the components
  of creative agents. We implement the imaginator with either a large language model
  for textual imagination or a diffusion model for visual imagination. The controller
  can either be a behavior-cloning policy or a pre-trained foundation model generating
  executable codes in the environment. We benchmark creative tasks with the challenging
  open-world game Minecraft, where the agents create diverse buildings given free-form
  language instructions. We propose novel evaluation metrics for open-ended creative
  tasks utilizing GPT-4V, which holds many advantages over existing metrics. We perform
  a detailed experimental analysis of creative agents, showing that creative agents
  are the first AI agents accomplishing diverse building creation in the survival
  mode of Minecraft. Our benchmark and models are open-source for future research
  on creative agents (https://github.com/PKU-RL/Creative-Agents).
