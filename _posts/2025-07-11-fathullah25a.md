title: Generalised Probabilistic Modelling and Improved Uncertainty Estimation in
  Comparative LLM-as-a-judge
abstract: This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty
  estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing Product-of-Experts
  methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling diverse modelling options.
  Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty estimates for individual comparisons,
  enabling more efficient selection and achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations.
  We also introduce a method for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally,
  we demonstrate that combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance.
  Experiments show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings
  but our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering,
  significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed comparisons
  by $\sim$50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used to identify
  low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic model has a notable
  impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.
