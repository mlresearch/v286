title: A Unified Data Representation Learning for Non-parametric Two-sample Testing
abstract: Learning effective data representations has been crucial in non-parametric
  two-sample testing. Common approaches will first split data into training and test
  sets and then learn data representations purely on the training set. However, recent
  theoretical studies have shown that, as long as the sample indexes are not used
  during the learning process, the whole data can be used to learn data representations,
  meanwhile ensuring control of Type-I errors. The above fact motivates us to use
  the test set (but without sample indexes) to facilitate the data representation
  learning in the testing. To this end, we propose a representation-learning two-sample
  testing (RL-TST) framework. RL-TST first performs purely self-supervised representation
  learning on the entire dataset to capture inherent representations (IRs) that reflect
  the underlying data manifold. A discriminative model is then trained on these IRs
  to learn discriminative representations (DRs), enabling the framework to leverage
  both the rich structural information from IRs and the discriminative power of DRs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-TST outperforms representative approaches
  by simultaneously using data manifold information in the test set and enhancing
  test power via finding the DRs with the training set.
