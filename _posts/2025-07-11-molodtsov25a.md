title: 'When Extragradient Meets PAGE: Bridging Two Giants to Boost Variational Inequalities'
abstract: Variational inequalities (VIs) have emerged as a universal framework for
  solving a wide range of problems. A broad spectrum of applications include optimization,
  equilibrium analysis, reinforcement learning, and the rapidly evolving field of
  generative adversarial networks (GANs). Stochastic methods have proven to be powerful
  tools for addressing such problems, but they often suffer from irreducible variance,
  necessitating the development of variance reduction techniques. Among these, SARAH-based
  algorithms have demonstrated remarkable practical effectiveness. In this work, we
  propose a new stochastic variance reduced algorithm for solving stochastic variational
  inequalities. We push the boundaries of existing methodologies by leveraging PAGE
  method to solve VIs. Unlike prior studies, which lacked theoretical guarantees under
  general assumptions, we establish rigorous convergence rates, thus closing a crucial
  gap in the literature. Our contributions extend both theoretical understanding and
  practical advancements in solving variational inequalities. To substantiate our
  claims, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks including widely
  studied denoising task. The results consistently showcase the superior efficiency
  of our approach, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.
