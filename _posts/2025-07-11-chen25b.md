title: 'Just Trial Once: Ongoing Causal Validation of Machine Learning Models'
abstract: 'Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used as decision-support
  tools in high-risk domains. Evaluating the causal impact of deploying such models
  can be done with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that randomizes users to ML
  vs. control groups and assesses the effect on relevant outcomes. However, ML models
  are inevitably updated over time, and we often lack evidence for the causal impact
  of these updates. While the causal effect could be repeatedly validated with ongoing
  RCTs, such experiments are expensive and time-consuming to run. In this work, we
  present an alternative solution: using only data from a prior RCT, we give conditions
  under which the causal impact of a new ML model can be precisely bounded or estimated,
  even if it was not included in the RCT. Our assumptions incorporate two realistic
  constraints: ML predictions are often deterministic, and their impacts depend on
  user trust in the model. Based on our analysis, we give recommendations for trial
  designs that maximize our ability to assess future versions of an ML model. Our
  hope is that our trial design recommendations will save practitioners time and resources
  while allowing for quicker deployments of updates to ML models.'
