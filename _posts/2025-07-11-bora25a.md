title: BELIEF - Bayesian Sign Entropy Regularization for LIME Framework
abstract: Explanations of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) are
  often inconsistent across different runs making them unreliable for eXplainable
  AI (XAI). The inconsistency stems from sign flips and variability in ranks of the
  segments for each different run. We propose a Bayesian Regularization approach to
  reduce sign flips, which in turn stabilizes feature rankings and ensures significantly
  higher consistency in explanations. The proposed approach enforces sparsity by incorporating
  a Sign Entropy prior on the coefficient distribution and dynamically eliminates
  features during optimization. Our results demonstrate that the explanations from
  the proposed method exhibit significantly better consistency and fidelity than LIME
  (and its earlier variants). Further, our approach exhibits comparable consistency
  and fidelity with a significantly lower execution time than the latest LIME variant,
  i.e., SLICE (CVPR 2024).
