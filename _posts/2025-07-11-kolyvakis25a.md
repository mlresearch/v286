title: A Multivariate Unimodality Test Harnessing the Dip Statistic of Mahalanobis
  Distances Over Random Projections
abstract: Unimodality, pivotal in statistical analysis, offers insights into dataset
  structures and drives sophisticated analytical procedures. While unimodality’s confirmation
  is straightforward for one-dimensional data using methods like Silverman’s approach
  and Hartigans’ dip statistic, its generalization to higher dimensions remains challenging.
  By extrapolating one-dimensional unimodality principles to multi-dimensional spaces
  through linear random projections and leveraging point-to-point distancing, our
  method, rooted in $\alpha$-unimodality assumptions, presents a novel multivariate
  unimodality test named $\textit{mud-pod}$. Both theoretical and empirical studies
  confirm the efficacy of our method in unimodality assessment of multidimensional
  datasets as well as in estimating the number of clusters.
