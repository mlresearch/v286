title: On Information-Theoretic Measures of Predictive Uncertainty
abstract: 'Reliable estimation of predictive uncertainty is crucial for machine learning
  applications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where hedging against risks
  is essential. Despite its significance, there is no universal agreement on how to
  best quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we revisit core concepts to
  propose a framework for information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty.
  Our proposed framework categorizes predictive uncertainty measures according to
  two factors: (I) The predicting model (II) The approximation of the true predictive
  distribution. Examining all possible combinations of these two factors, we derive
  a set of predictive uncertainty measures that includes both known and newly introduced
  ones. We extensively evaluate these measures across a broad set of tasks, identifying
  conditions under which certain measures excel. Our findings show the importance
  of aligning the choice of uncertainty measure with the predicting model on in-distribution
  (ID) data, the limitations of epistemic uncertainty measures for out-of-distribution
  (OOD) data, and that the disentanglement between measures varies substantially between
  ID and OOD data. Together, these insights provide a more comprehensive understanding
  of predictive uncertainty measures, revealing their implicit assumptions and relationships.'
