title: Using Submodular Optimization to Approximate Minimum-Size Abductive Path Explanations
  for Tree-Based Models
abstract: One of the key challenges of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is
  providing concise and understandable explanations for classification model predictions.
  An abductive explanation for a given instance is a minimal set of features that
  justify the prediction. These minimal explanations are valuable for their interpretability,
  as they eliminate redundant or irrelevant information. However, computing these
  explanations is difficult, even for simpler classifiers like decision trees. Finding
  a minimum-size abductive explanation in decision trees is an NP-complete problem,
  and this complexity extends to random forests for minimum-size majoritary reasons.
  In this work, we focus on finding minimal sets of features along the paths leading
  to the decision, called path-abductive explanations. We show that the problem of
  finding minimum-size path-abductive explanations in decision trees and minimum-size
  path-majoritary reasons in random forests is also NP-complete. To address this,
  we reformulate the problem as a submodular optimization task and propose a greedy
  algorithm with optimality guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate that this algorithm
  produces near-optimal explanations efficiently and offers a strong alternative for
  difficult instances, where exact methods based on SAT encodings are computationally
  expensive. This approach is especially useful in resource-limited environments where
  modern SAT solvers are not feasible.
