title: Group-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Heterogeneous Agents
abstract: Group-agent reinforcement learning (GARL) is a newly arising learning scenario,
  where multiple reinforcement learning agents study together in a group, sharing
  knowledge in an asynchronous fashion. The goal is to improve the learning performance
  of each individual agent. Under a more general heterogeneous setting where different
  agents learn using different algorithms, we advance GARL by designing novel and
  effective group-learning mechanisms. They guide the agents on whether and how to
  learn from action choices from the others, and allow the agents to adopt available
  policy and value function models sent by another agent if they perform better. We
  have conducted extensive experiments on a total of 43 different Atari 2600 games
  to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. After the group
  learning, among the 129 agents examined, 96% are able to achieve a learning speed-up,
  and 72% are able to learn $\geq 100$ times faster. Also, around 41% of those agents
  have achieved a higher accumulated reward score by learning in $\leq 5%$ of the
  time steps required by a single agent when learning on its own.
