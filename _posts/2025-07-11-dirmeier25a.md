title: Simulation-based Inference for High-dimensional Data using Surjective Sequential
  Neural Likelihood Estimation
abstract: Neural likelihood estimation methods for simulation-based inference can
  suffer from performance degradation when the modeled data is very high-dimensional
  or lies along a lower-dimensional manifold, which is due to the inability of the
  density estimator to accurately estimate a density function. We present Surjective
  Sequential Neural Likelihood (SSNL) estimation, a novel member in the family of
  methods for simulation-based inference (SBI). SSNL fits a dimensionality-reducing
  surjective normalizing flow model and uses it as a surrogate likelihood function,
  which allows for computational inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational
  Bayes methods. Among other benefits, SSNL avoids the requirement to manually craft
  summary statistics for inference of high-dimensional data sets, since the lower-dimensional
  representation is computed simultaneously with learning the likelihood and without
  additional computational overhead. We evaluate SSNL on a wide variety of experiments,
  including two challenging real-world examples from the astrophysics and neuroscience
  literatures, and show that it either outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art
  methods, making it an excellent off-the-shelf estimator for SBI for high-dimensional
  data sets.
