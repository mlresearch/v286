title: Optimal Submanifold Structure in Log-linear Models
abstract: In the modeling of discrete distributions using log-linear models, the model
  selection process is equivalent to imposing zero-value constraints on a subset of
  natural parameters, which is an established concept in information geometry. This
  zero-value constraint has been implicitly employed, from classic Boltzmann machines
  to recent many-body approximations of tensors. However, in theory, any constant
  value other than zero can be used for these constraints, leading to different submanifolds
  onto which the empirical distribution is projected, a possibility that has not been
  explored. Here, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of these constraint values
  from the perspective of information geometry. Specifically, we prove that the optimal
  value converges to zero as the size of the support of the empirical distribution
  increases, which corresponds to the size of the input tensors in the context of
  tensor decomposition. While our primary focus is on many-body approximation of tensors,
  it is straightforward to extend this analysis to a wide range of log-linear modeling
  applications.
