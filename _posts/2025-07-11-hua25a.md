title: Simulation-Free Differential Dynamics Through Neural Conservation Laws
abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
  diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods typically
  involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process—which only works for heavily
  restricted problem formulations—or require expensive simulation to numerically obtain
  the time-dependent densities and sample from the diffusion process. In contrast,
  we propose a coupled parameterization which jointly models a time-dependent density
  function, or probability path, and the dynamics of a diffusion process that generates
  this probability path. To accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck
  equation and density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and
  greatly simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables simulation-free
  training for a large variety of problem formulations, from data-driven objectives
  as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal transport, to optimality-based objectives
  as in stochastic optimal control, with straightforward extensions to mean-field
  objectives due to the ease of accessing exact density functions. We validate our
  method in a diverse range of application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events,
  to learning optimal dynamics from population data.
