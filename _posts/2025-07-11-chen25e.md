title: 'NRFlow: Towards Noise-Robust Generative Modeling via High-Order Mechanism'
abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown promise in various machine learning
  applications, but they often face challenges in handling noise and ensuring robustness
  in trajectory estimation. In this work, we propose NRFlow, a novel extension to
  flow-based generative modeling that incorporates second-order dynamics through acceleration
  fields. We develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to analyze the regularization
  effects of high-order terms and derive noise robustness guarantees. Our method leverages
  a two-part loss function to simultaneously train first-order velocity fields and
  high-order acceleration fields, enhancing both smoothness and stability in learned
  transport trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-order flow
  matching for robust generative modeling in complex and noisy environments.
