title: Federated Rényi Fair Inference in Federated Heterogeneous System
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) is a prominent distributed learning approach that
  addresses two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity (i.e., non-identically
  distributed data) and system heterogeneity (i.e., variability in the communication
  and computation on each client). As FL is commonly applied in sectors such as commercial
  and financial, group disparities may emerge and cause harm. However, current fairness
  algorithms assume homogeneous data, which does not align with the FL context. The
  main challenge is estimating global fairness measures (e.g., Rényi or Pearson correlation)
  in an asynchronous, heterogeneous system. To address this, we propose the FedRényi
  algorithm, which regularizes fairness by Rényi correlation. For statistical heterogeneity,
  FedRényi aggregates local fairness statistics to estimate the global Rényi correlation
  with an estimation error bound of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the total number
  of data samples. This theoretical result improves significantly over the prior result
  $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ with $K$ clients. We further prove that FedRényi converges at the
  same rate as in the homogeneous setting. For system heterogeneity, FedRényi approximates
  missing client updates through weighted averaging over a nearest neighbor region,
  ensuring a non-expansive approximation error under non-convex conditions. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that FedRényi achieves a promising fairness-accuracy trade-off,
  with at least 2\% improvement over baselines.'
