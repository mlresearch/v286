title: Minimax Optimal Nonsmooth Nonparametric Regression via Fractional Laplacian
  Eigenmaps
abstract: We develop minimax optimal estimators for nonparametric regression methods
  when the true regression function lies in an $L_2$-fractional Sobolev space with
  order $s\in (0,1)$. This function class is a Hilbert space lying between the space
  of square-integrable functions and the first-order Sobolev space consisting of differentiable
  functions. It contains fractional power functions, piecewise constant or piecewise
  polynomial functions and bump function as canonical examples. We construct an estimator
  based on performing Principal Component Regression using Fractional Laplacian Eigenmaps
  and show that the in-sample mean-squared estimation error of this estimator is of
  order $n^{-\frac{2s}{2s+d}}$, where $d$ is the dimension, $s$ is the order parameter
  and $n$ is the number of observations. We next prove a minimax lower bound of the
  same order, thereby establishing that no other estimator can improve upon the proposed
  estimator, up to context factors. We also provide preliminary empirical results
  validating the practical performance of the developed estimators.
