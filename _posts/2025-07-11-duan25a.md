title: Probabilistic Semantics Guided Discovery of Approximate Functional Dependencies
abstract: As the general description of relationships between attributes, approximate
  functional dependencies (AFDs) almost hold for a given dataset with a few violations.
  Most of existing methods for AFD discover are insufficient to balance the efficiency
  and accuracy due to the massive search space and permission of violations. To address
  these issues, we propose an efficient method of probabilistic semantics guided discovery
  of AFDs based on Bayesian network (BN). Firstly, we learn a BN structure and conduct
  conditional independence tests on the learned structure rather than the entire search
  space, such that candidate AFDs could be obtained. Secondly, we fulfill search space
  reduction and structure pruning by making use of probabilistic semantics of graphical
  models in terms of BN. Consequently, we provide a branch-and-bound algorithm to
  discover the AFDs with the highest smoothed mutual information scores. Experimental
  results illustrate that our proposed method is more effective and efficient than
  the comparison methods. Our code is available at [https://github.com/DKE-Code/BNAFD](https://github.com/DKE-Code/BNAFD).
