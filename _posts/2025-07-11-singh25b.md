title: Learning from Label Proportions and Covariate-shifted Instances
abstract: In many applications, especially due to lack of supervision or privacy concerns,
  the training data is grouped into bags of instances (feature-vectors) and for each
  bag we have only an aggregate label derived from the instance-labels in the bag.
  In learning from label proportions (LLP) the aggregate label is the average of the
  instance-labels in a bag, and a significant body of work has focused on training
  models in the LLP setting to predict instance-labels. In practice however, the training
  data may have fully supervised albeit covariate-shifted source data, along with
  the usual target data with bag-labels, and we wish to train a good instance-level
  predictor on the target domain. We call this the covariate-shifted hybrid LLP problem.
  Fully supervised covariate shifted data often has useful training signals and the
  goal is to leverage them for better predictive performance in the hybrid LLP setting.
  To achieve this, we develop methods for hybrid LLP which naturally incorporate the
  target bag-labels along with the source instance-labels, in the domain adaptation
  framework. Apart from proving theoretical guarantees bounding the target generalization
  error, we also conduct experiments on several publicly available datasets showing
  that our methods outperform LLP and domain adaptation baselines as well techniques
  from previous related work.
