title: Toward Universal Laws of Outlier Propagation
abstract: When a variety of anomalous features motivate flagging different samples
  as *outliers*, Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) offers a principled way to unify
  them in terms of a sample’s *randomness deficiency*. Subject to the Independence
  of Mechanisms Principle, we show that for a joint sample on the nodes of a causal
  Bayesian network, the randomness deficiency decomposes into a sum of randomness
  deficiencies at each causal mechanism. Consequently, anomalous observations can
  be attributed to their root causes, i.e., the mechanisms that behaved anomalously.
  As an extension of Levin’s law of randomness conservation, we show that weak outliers
  cannot cause strong ones. We show how these information theoretic laws clarify our
  understanding of outlier detection and attribution, in the context of more specialized
  outlier scores from prior literature.
