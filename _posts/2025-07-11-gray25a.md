title: Guaranteed Prediction Sets for Functional Surrogate Models
abstract: 'We propose a method for obtaining statistically guaranteed prediction sets
  for functional machine learning methods: surrogate models which map between function
  spaces, motivated by the need to build reliable PDE emulators. The method constructs
  nested prediction sets on a low-dimensional representation (an SVD) of the surrogate
  modelâ€™s error, and then maps these sets to the prediction space using set-propagation
  techniques. This results in prediction sets for functional surrogate models with
  conformal prediction coverage guarantees. We use zonotopes as basis of the set construction,
  which allow an exact linear propagation and are closed under Cartesian products,
  making them well-suited to this high-dimensional problem. The method is model agnostic
  and can thus be applied to complex Sci-ML models, including Neural Operators, but
  also in simpler settings. We also introduce a technique to capture the truncation
  error of the SVD, preserving the guarantees of the method.'
