title: An Information-theoretic Perspective of Hierarchical Clustering on Graphs
abstract: The seminal work of \citep{dasgupta2016cost} has introduced a combinatorial
  cost function for hierarchical graph clustering that has inspired numerous follow-up
  studies adopting similar combinatorial approaches. In this paper, we investigate
  this problem from the \emph{information-theoretic} perspective. We formulate a new
  cost function that is fully explainable and establish the relationship between combinatorial
  and information-theoretic perspectives. We present two algorithms for expander-like
  and well-clustered cardinality weighted graphs, respectively, and show that both
  of them achieve $O(1)$-approximation for our new cost function. Addressing practical
  needs, we consider non-binary hierarchical clustering problem, and propose a hyperparameter-free
  framework HCSE that recursively stratifies cluster trees through sparsity-aware
  partitioning, automatically determining the optimal hierarchy depth via an interpretable
  mechanism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our cost
  function and algorithms in binary clustering performance, hierarchy level identification,
  and reconstruction accuracy compared to existing approaches.
