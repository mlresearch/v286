title: 'Beyond Invisibility:  Learning Robust Visible Watermarks for Stronger Copyright
  Protection'
abstract: As AI advances, copyrighted content faces growing risk of unauthorized use,
  whether through model training or direct misuse. Building upon invisible adversarial
  perturbation, recent works developed copyright protections against specific AI techniques
  such as unauthorized personalization through DreamBooth that are misused. However,
  these methods offer only short-term security, as they require retraining whenever
  the underlying model architectures change. To establish long-term protection aiming
  at better robustness, we go beyond invisible perturbation, and propose a universal
  approach that embeds \textit{visible} watermarks that are \textit{hard-to-remove}
  into images. Grounded in a new probabilistic and inverse problem-based formulation,
  our framework maximizes the discrepancy between the \textit{optimal} reconstruction
  and the original content. We develop an effective and efficient approximation algorithm
  to circumvent a intractable bi-level optimization. Experimental results demonstrate
  superiority of our approach across diverse scenarios.
