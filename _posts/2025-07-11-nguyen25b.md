title: 'Stochastic Embeddings : A Probabilistic and Geometric Analysis of Out-of-Distribution
  Behavior'
abstract: 'Deep neural networks perform well in many applications but often fail when
  exposed to out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs. We identify a geometric phenomenon
  in the embedding space: in-distribution (ID) data show higher variance than OoD
  data under stochastic perturbations. Using high-dimensional geometry and statistics,
  we explain this behavior and demonstrate its application in improving OoD detection.
  Unlike traditional post-hoc methods, our approach integrates uncertainty-aware tools,
  such as Bayesian approximations, directly into the detection process. Then, we show
  how considering the unit hypersphere enhances the separation of ID and OoD samples.
  Our mathematically sound method achieves competitive performance while remaining
  simple.'
