title: 'MOHITO: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using Hypergraphs for Task-Open
  Systems'
abstract: Open agent systems are prevalent in the real world, where the sets of agents
  and tasks change over time. In this paper, we focus on task-open multi-agent systems,
  exemplified by applications such as ridesharing, where passengers (tasks) appear
  spontaneously over time and disappear if not attended to promptly. Task-open settings
  challenge us with an action space which changes dynamically. This renders existing
  reinforcement learning (RL) methods–intended for fixed state and action spaces–inapplicable.
  Whereas multi-task learning approaches learn policies generalized to multiple known
  and related tasks, they struggle to adapt to previously unseen tasks. Conversely,
  lifelong learning adapts to new tasks over time, but generally assumes that tasks
  come sequentially from a static and known distribution rather than simultaneously
  and unpredictably. We introduce a novel category of RL for addressing task openness,
  modeled using a task-open Markov game. Our approach, MOHITO, is a multi-agent actor-critic
  schema which represents knowledge about the relationships between agents and changing
  tasks and actions as dynamically evolving 3-uniform hypergraphs. As popular multi-agent
  RL testbeds do not exhibit task openness, we evaluate MOHITO on two realistic and
  naturally task-open domains to establish its efficacy and provide a benchmark for
  future work in this setting.
