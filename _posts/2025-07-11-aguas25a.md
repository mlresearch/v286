title: Causal Inference amid Missingness-Specific Independences and Mechanism Shifts
abstract: 'The recovery of causal effects in structural models with missing data often
  relies on $m$-graphs, which assume that missingness mechanisms do not directly influence
  substantive variables. Yet, in many real-world settings, missing data can alter
  decision-making processes, as the absence of key information may affect downstream
  actions and states. To overcome this limitation, we introduce $lm$-SCMs and $lm$-graphs,
  which extend $m$-graphs by integrating a label set that represents relevant context-specific
  independencies (CSI), accounting for mechanism shifts induced by missingness. We
  define two causal effects within these systems: the Full Average Treatment Effect
  (FATE), which reflects the effect in a hypothetical scenario had no data been missing,
  and the Natural Average Treatment Effect (NATE), which captures the effect under
  the unaltered CSIs in the system. We propose recovery criteria for these queries
  and present doubly-robust estimators for a graphical model inspired by a real-world
  application. Simulations highlight key differences between these estimands and estimation
  methods. Findings from the application case suggest a small effect of ADHD treatment
  upon test achievement among Norwegian children, with a slight effect shift due to
  missing pre-tests scores.'
