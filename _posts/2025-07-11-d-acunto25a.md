title: The Relativity of Causal Knowledge
abstract: Recent advances in *artificial intelligence* reveal the limits of purely
  predictive systems and call for a shift toward causal *and* collaborative reasoning.
  Drawing inspiration from the revolution of Grothendieck in mathematics, we introduce
  the *relativity of causal knowledge*, which posits structural causal models (SCMs)
  are inherently imperfect, subjective representations embedded within networks of
  relationships. By leveraging category theory, we arrange SCMs into a functor category
  and show that their observational and interventional probability measures naturally
  form convex structures. This result allows us to encode non-intervened SCMs with
  convex spaces of probability measures. Next, using sheaf theory, we construct the
  *network sheaf and cosheaf of causal knowledge*. These structures enable the transfer
  of causal knowledge across the network while incorporating interventional consistency
  and the perspective of the subjects, ultimately leading to the formal, mathematical
  definition of *relative causal knowledge*.
