title: Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models
abstract: 'Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
  based on their similarity to a target, \emph{e.g.}, in the context of information
  retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of similarity
  choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a property that allows
  for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been detected in many discrete
  choice settings, the similarity choice setting has received scant attention. This
  is because the target-dependent nature of the choice complicates IIA testing. We
  propose two statistical methods to test for IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test
  and a Bayesian counterpart based on the framework of Posterior Predictive Checks
  (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our main technical contribution, quantifies the degree
  of IIA violation beyond its mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with
  choice sets designed to elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated
  choice sets from the same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations
  on both datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between
  them. Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show
  that the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
  driven by context effectsâ€”specifically, interactions within the choice sets. These
  results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account for such
  context effects.'
