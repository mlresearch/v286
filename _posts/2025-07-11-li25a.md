title: Trading Off Voting Axioms for Privacy
abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate tradeoffs among differential privacy (DP)
  and several important voting axioms: Pareto efficiency, SD-efficiency, PC-efficiency,
  Condorcet criterion, and Condorcet loser criterion. We provide upper and lower bounds
  on the two-way tradeoffs between DP and each axiom. We also provide upper and lower
  bounds on three-way tradeoffs among DP and every pairwise combination of all the
  axioms, showing that, while the axioms are compatible without DP, their upper bounds
  cannot be achieved simultaneously under DP. Our results illustrate the effect of
  DP on the satisfaction and compatibility of voting axioms.'
