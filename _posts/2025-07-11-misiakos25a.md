title: 'SpinSVAR: Estimating Structural Vector Autoregression Assuming Sparse Input'
abstract: 'We introduce SpinSVAR, a novel method for estimating a (linear) structural
  vector autoregression (SVAR) from time-series data under a sparse input assumption.
  Unlike prior approaches using Gaussian noise, we model the input as independent
  and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Laplacian variables, enforcing sparsity and
  yielding a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) based on least absolute error regression.
  We provide theoretical consistency guarantees for the MLE under mild assumptions.
  SpinSVAR is efficient: it can leverage GPU acceleration to scale to thousands of
  nodes. On synthetic data with Laplacian or Bernoulli-uniform inputs, SpinSVAR outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and runtime. When applied to S&P 500 data,
  it clusters stocks by sectors and identifies significant structural shocks linked
  to major price movements, demonstrating the viability of our sparse input assumption.'
