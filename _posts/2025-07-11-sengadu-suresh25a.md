title: Adaptive Human-Robot Collaboration using Type-Based IRL
abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) integrates the consistency and precision
  of robotic systems with the dexterity and cognitive abilities of humans to create
  synergy. However, human performance may degrade due to various factors (e.g., fatigue,
  trust) which can manifest unpredictably, and typically results in diminished output
  and reduced quality. To address this challenge toward successful HRCs, we present
  a human-aware approach to collaboration using a novel multi-agent decision-making
  framework. Type-based decentralized Markov decision processes (TB-DecMDP) additionally
  model latent, causal decision-making factors influencing agent behavior (e.g., fatigue),
  leading to dynamic agent types. In this framework, agents can switch between types
  and each maintains a belief about othersâ€™ current type based on observed actions
  while aiming to achieve a shared objective. We introduce a new inverse reinforcement
  learning (IRL) algorithm, TB-DecAIRL, which uses TB-DecMDP to model complex HRCs.
  TB-DecAIRL learns a type-contingent reward function and corresponding vector of
  policies from team demonstrations. Our evaluations in a realistic HRC problem setting
  establish that modeling human types in TB-DecAIRL improves robot behavior on the
  default of ignoring human factors, by increasing throughput in a human-robot produce
  sorting task.
