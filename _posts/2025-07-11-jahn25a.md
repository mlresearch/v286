title: Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes
abstract: 'Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to
  their Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made.
  The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be learned
  about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under the assumptions
  of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior, Markov equivalence
  classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we show that this is no
  longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed. Specifically, we prove
  exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes
  in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic
  directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs.'
