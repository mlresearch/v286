title: Out-of-distribution Robust Optimization
abstract: In this paper, we consider the contextual robust optimization problem under
  an out-of-distribution setting. The contextual robust optimization problem considers
  a risk-sensitive objective function for an optimization problem with the presence
  of a context vector (also known as covariates or side information) capturing related
  information. While the existing works mainly consider the in-distribution setting,
  and the resultant robustness achieved is in an out-of-sample sense, our paper studies
  an out-of-distribution setting where there can be a difference between the test
  environment and the training environment where the data are collected. We propose
  methods that handle this out-of-distribution setting, and the key relies on a density
  ratio estimation for the distribution shift. We show that additional structures
  such as covariate shift and label shift are not only helpful in defending distribution
  shift but also necessary in avoiding non-trivial solutions compared to other principled
  methods such as distributionally robust optimization. We also illustrate how the
  covariates can be useful in this procedure. Numerical experiments generate more
  intuitions and demonstrate that the proposed methods can help avoid over-conservative
  solutions.
