title: 'FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Short-Term
  Flight Trajectory Prediction'
abstract: Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role
  in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main
  issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The
  first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant
  differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories
  involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal
  the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time
  scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch
  network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically,
  FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values
  of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings
  for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced
  to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse
  temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately
  designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked
  patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different
  time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different
  scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make
  direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate
  that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.
