title: Symbiotic Local Search for Small Decision Tree Policies in MDPs
abstract: We study decision making policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Two
  key performance indicators of such policies are their value and their interpretability.
  On the one hand, policies that optimize value can be efficiently computed via a
  plethora of standard methods. However, the representation of these policies may
  prevent their interpretability. On the other hand, policies with good interpretability,
  such as policies represented by a small decision tree, are computationally hard
  to obtain. This paper contributes a local search approach to find policies with
  good value, represented by small decision trees. Our local search symbiotically
  combines learning decision trees from value-optimal policies with symbolic approaches
  that optimize the size of the decision tree within a constrained neighborhood. Our
  empirical evaluation shows that this combination provides drastically smaller decision
  trees for MDPs that are significantly larger than what can be handled by optimal
  decision tree learners.
