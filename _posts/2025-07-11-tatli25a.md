title: Metric Learning in an RKHS
abstract: This paper investigates metric learning in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
  Space (RKHS) based on a set of random triplet comparisons in the form of *"Do you
  think item h is more similar to item i or item j?"* indicating similarity and differences
  between various items. The goal is to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the
  comparisons. Nonlinear metric learning using kernel methods and neural networks
  has shown great empirical promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects
  of this problem, there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods.
  The exception is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard $d$-dimensional
  Euclidean space; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in the $d$-dimensional
  Euclidean space. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric learning
  and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds. We validate
  our findings through a set of simulations and experiments on real datasets. Our
  code is publicly available at https://github.com/RamyaLab/metric-learning-RKHS.
