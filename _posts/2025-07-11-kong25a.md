title: 'DF$^2$: Distribution-Free Decision-Focused Learning'
abstract: 'Decision-focused learning (DFL), which differentiates through the KKT conditions,
  has recently emerged as a powerful approach for predict-then-optimize problems.
  However, under probabilistic settings, DFL faces three major bottlenecks: model
  mismatch error, sample average approximation error, and gradient approximation error.
  Model mismatch error stems from the misalignment between the modelâ€™s parameterized
  predictive distribution and the true probability distribution. Sample average approximation
  error arises when using finite samples to approximate the expected optimization
  objective. Gradient approximation error occurs when the objectives are non-convex
  and KKT conditions cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we present DF$^2$-the
  first \textit{distribution-free} decision-focused learning method designed to mitigate
  these three bottlenecks. Rather than depending on a task-specific forecaster that
  requires precise model assumptions, our method directly learns the expected optimization
  function during training. To efficiently learn the function in a data-driven manner,
  we devise an attention-based model architecture inspired by the distribution-based
  parameterization of the expected objective. We evaluate DF$^2$ on two synthetic
  problems and three real-world problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of DF$^2$.
