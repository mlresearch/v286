title: 'Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic
  Inference over Graphs'
abstract: 'Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success
  in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent
  performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is,
  at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations
  that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions,
  intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even
  the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific
  to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic
  graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient
  probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving
  both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting
  of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements,
  yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative
  strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the
  second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance
  can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach
  is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the
  context of molecular graph generation.'
