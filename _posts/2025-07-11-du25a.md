title: Tuning Algorithmic and Architectural Hyperparameters in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised
  Learning with Provable Guarantees
abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning is a powerful paradigm in machine learning
  for modeling and exploiting the underlying graph structure that captures the relationship
  between labeled and unlabeled data. A large number of classical as well as modern
  deep learning based algorithms have been proposed for this problem, often having
  tunable hyperparameters. We initiate a formal study of tuning algorithm hyperparameters
  from parameterized algorithm families for this problem. We obtain novel $O(\log
  n)$ pseudo-dimension upper bounds for hyperparameter selection in three classical
  label propagation-based algorithm families, where $n$ is the number of nodes, implying
  bounds on the amount of data needed for learning provably good parameters. We further
  provide matching $\Omega(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension lower bounds, thus asymptotically
  characterizing the learning-theoretic complexity of the parameter tuning problem.
  We extend our study to selecting architectural hyperparameters in modern graph neural
  networks. We bound the Rademacher complexity for tuning the self-loop weighting
  in recently proposed Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) networks. We further propose
  a tunable architecture that interpolates graph convolutional neural networks (GCN)
  and graph attention networks (GAT) in every layer, and provide Rademacher complexity
  bounds for tuning the interpolation coefficient.
