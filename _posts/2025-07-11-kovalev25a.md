title: An Optimal Algorithm for Strongly Convex Min-Min Optimization
abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a function $ f(x, y) $, where $ f
  $ is a smooth and strongly convex function with respect to both variables, being
  $ \mu_x $-strongly convex in $ x $ and $ \mu_y $-strongly convex in $ y $. The optimal
  accelerated gradient method of Yurii Nesterov achieves a convergence rate that requires
  approximately $ \mathcal{O}((\min(\mu_x, \mu_y))^{-1/2}) $ evaluations of the partial
  gradients $ \nabla_x f $ and $ \nabla_y f $. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization
  algorithm that improves upon this complexity by requiring only $ \mathcal{O}(\mu_x^{-1/2})
  $ computations of $ \nabla_x f $ and $ \mathcal{O}(\mu_y^{-1/2}) $ computations
  of $ \nabla_y f $. This improvement is particularly advantageous in scenarios where
  there is a significant disparity between the strong convexity parameters, specifically
  when $ \mu_x \gg \mu_y $. Furthermore, in practical applications where the computation
  of $ \nabla_y f $ is considerably more efficient than that of $ \nabla_x f $, the
  proposed method leads to a substantial reduction in the overall wall-clock time
  required for optimization. As a key application, we consider Partially Local Federated
  Learning, a setting in which the model is partitioned into a local component and
  a global component. We demonstrate how our proposed method can be effectively applied
  in this framework, highlighting its practical advantages in improving computational
  efficiency.
