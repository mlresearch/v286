title: 'Divide and Orthogonalize: Efficient Continual Learning with Local Model Space
  Projection'
abstract: Continual learning (CL) has gained increasing interest in recent years due
  to the need for models that can continuously learn new tasks while retaining knowledge
  from previous ones. However, existing CL methods often require either computationally
  expensive layer-wise gradient projections or large-scale storage of past task data,
  making them impractical for resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges,
  we propose a local model space projection (LMSP)-based continual learning framework
  that significantly reduces computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
  while preserving both forward and backward knowledge transfer with minimal performance
  trade-offs. We establish a theoretical analysis of the error and convergence properties
  of LMSP compared to conventional global approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple
  public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while
  offering substantial efficiency gains, making it a promising solution for scalable
  continual learning.
