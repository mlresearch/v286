title: Root Cause Analysis of Failures from Partial Causal Structures
abstract: 'Finding the root cause of failures is a prominent problem in many complex
  networks. Causal inference provides us with tools to address this problem algorithmically
  to automate this process and solve it efficiently. The existing methods either use
  a known causal structure to identify root cause by backtracking the changes, or
  ignore the causal structure but relies on invariance tests to identify the changing
  causal mechanisms after the failure. Assuming a single, unknown root cause, we first
  establish a novel connection between root cause analysis and the \textit{Interactive
  Graph Search (IGS)} problem. This mapping highlights the importance of causal knowledge:
  we demonstrate that any algorithm relying solely on marginal invariance tests to
  identify the root cause must perform at least $\Omega(\log_{2}(n) + d\log_{1+d}n)$
  many tests, where $n$ represents the number of components and $d$ denotes the maximum
  out-degree of the graph. We then present an optimal algorithm that achieves this
  bound by reducing the root cause identification problem as an instance of IGS. Beyond
  the single root cause scenario, we propose a practical extension for settings with
  multiple root causes and partial causal knowledge. More specifically, we show that
  even if the causal graph is partially known, we can identify the root-causes with
  a linear number of invariance tests. This is the first known result on incorporating
  a partial causal structure for root cause analysis. Our experiments on a production-level
  application demonstrate that, even in the absence of complete causal information,
  our approach accurately identifies the root causes of failures.'
