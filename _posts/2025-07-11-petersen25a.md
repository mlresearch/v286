title: Are You Doing Better Than Random Guessing? A Call for Using Negative Controls
  When Evaluating Causal Discovery Algorithms
abstract: 'New proposals for causal discovery algorithms are typically evaluated using
  simulations and a few selected real data examples with known data generating mechanisms.
  However, there does not exist a general guideline for how such evaluation studies
  should be designed, and therefore, comparing results across different studies can
  be difficult. In this article, we propose to use negative controls as a common evaluation
  baseline by posing the question: Are we doing better than random guessing? For the
  task of graph skeleton estimation, we derive exact distributional results under
  random guessing for the expected behavior of a range of typical causal discovery
  evaluation metrics, including precision and recall. We show that these metrics can
  achieve very favorable values under random guessing in certain scenarios, and hence
  warn against using them without also reporting negative control results, i.e., performance
  under random guessing. We also propose an exact test of overall skeleton fit, and
  showcase its use on a real data application. Finally, we propose a general pipeline
  for using negative controls beyond the skeleton estimation task, and apply it both
  in a simulated example and a real data application.'
