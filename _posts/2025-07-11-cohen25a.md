title: RL, but don’t do anything I wouldn’t do
abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), if the agent’s reward differs from the designers’
  true utility, even only rarely, the state distribution resulting from the agent’s
  policy can be very bad, in theory and in practice. When RL policies would devolve
  into undesired behavior, a common countermeasure is KL regularization to a trusted
  policy ("Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do"). All current cutting-edge language models
  are RL agents that are KL-regularized to a "base policy" that is purely predictive.
  Unfortunately, we demonstrate that when this base policy is a Bayesian predictive
  model of a trusted policy, the KL constraint is no longer reliable for controlling
  the behavior of an advanced RL agent. We demonstrate this theoretically using algorithmic
  information theory, and while systems today are too weak to exhibit this theorized
  failure precisely, we RL-finetune a language model and find evidence that our formal
  results are plausibly relevant in practice. We also propose a theoretical alternative
  that avoids this problem by replacing the "Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do" principle
  with "Don’t do anything I mightn’t do".
