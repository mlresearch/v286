title: Conformal Prediction without Nonconformity Scores
abstract: 'Conformal prediction (CP) is an uncertainty quantification framework that
  allows for constructing statistically valid prediction sets. Key to the construction
  of these sets is the notion of a nonconformity function, which assigns a real-valued
  score to individual data points: only those (hypothetical) data points contribute
  to a prediction set that sufficiently conform to the data. The point of departure
  of this work is the observation that CP predictions are invariant against (strictly)
  monotone transformations of the nonconformity function. In other words, it is only
  the ordering of the scores that matters, not their quantitative values. Consequently,
  instead of scoring individual data points, a conformal predictor only needs to be
  able to compare pairs of data points, deciding which of them is the more conforming
  one. This suggests an interesting connection between CP and preference learning,
  in particular learning-to-rank methods, and makes CP amenable to training data in
  the form of (qualitative) preferences. Elaborating on this connection, we propose
  methods for preference-based CP and show their usefulness in real-world classification
  tasks.'
