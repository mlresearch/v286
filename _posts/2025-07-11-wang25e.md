title: 'VADIS: Investigating Inter-View Representation Biases for Multi-View Partial
  Multi-Label Learning'
abstract: Multi-view partial multi-label learning (MVPML) deals with training data
  where each example is represented by multiple feature vectors and associated with
  a set of candidate labels, only a subset of which are correct. The diverse representation
  biases present in different views complicate the annotation process in MVPML, leading
  to the inclusion of incorrect labels in the candidate label set. Existing methods
  typically merge features from different views to identify the correct labels in
  the training data without addressing the representation biases inherent in different
  views. In this paper, we propose a novel MVPML method called \textsc{Vadis}, which
  investigates view-aware representations for disambiguation and predictive model
  learning. Specifically, we exploit the global common representation shared by all
  views, aligning it with a local semantic similarity matrix to estimate ground-truth
  labels via a low-rank mapping matrix. Additionally, to identify incorrect labels,
  the view-specific inconsistent representation is recovered by leveraging the sparsity
  assumption. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach
  over other state-of-the-art methods.
