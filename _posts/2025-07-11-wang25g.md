title: Informative Synthetic Data Generation for Thorax Disease Classification
abstract: 'Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including architectures such as Vision Transformers
  (ViTs), have achieved remarkable success in medical imaging tasks. However, their
  performance typically hinges on the availability of large-scale, high-quality labeled
  datasets-resources that are often scarce or infeasible to obtain in medical domains.
  Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) offers a promising remedy by supplementing training
  sets with synthetic data generated via generative models like Diffusion Models (DMs).
  Yet, this approach introduces a critical challenge: synthetic data often contains
  significant noise, which can degrade the performance of classifiers trained on such
  augmented datasets. Prior solutions, including data selection and re-weighting techniques,
  often rely on access to clean metadata or pretrained external classifiers. In this
  work, we propose \emph{Informative Data Selection} (IDS), a principled sample re-weighting
  framework grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. IDS assigns higher
  weights to more informative synthetic samples, thereby improving classifier performance
  in GDA-enhanced training for thorax disease classification. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that IDS significantly outperforms existing data selection and re-weighting
  baselines. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/IDS}.'
