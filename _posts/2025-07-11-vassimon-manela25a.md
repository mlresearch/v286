title: Testing Generalizability in Causal Inference
abstract: Ensuring robust model performance in diverse real-world scenarios requires
  addressing generalizability across domains with covariate shifts. However, no formal
  procedure exists for statistically evaluating generalizability in machine learning
  algorithms. Existing methods often rely on arbitrary proxy predictive metrics like
  mean squared error, but do not directly answer whether a model can or cannot generalize.
  To address this gap in the domain of causal inference, we propose a systematic framework
  for statistically evaluating the generalizability of high-dimensional causal inference
  models. Our approach uses the frugal parameterization to flexibly simulate from
  fully and semi-synthetic causal benchmarks, offering a comprehensive evaluation
  for both mean and distributional regression methods. Grounded in real-world data,
  our method ensures more realistic evaluations, which is often missing in current
  work relying on simplified datasets. Furthermore, using simulations and statistical
  testing, our framework is robust and avoids over-reliance on conventional metrics,
  providing statistical safeguards for decision making.
