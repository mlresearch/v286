title: 'CP$^2$: Leveraging Geometry for Conformal Prediction via Canonicalization'
abstract: We study the problem of *conformal prediction* (CP) under geometric data
  shifts, where data samples are susceptible to transformations such as rotations
  or flips. While CP endows prediction models with *post-hoc* uncertainty quantification
  and formal coverage guarantees, their practicality breaks under distribution shifts
  that deteriorate model performance. To address this issue, we propose integrating
  geometric information-such as geometric pose-into the conformal procedure to reinstate
  its guarantees and ensure robustness under geometric shifts. In particular, we explore
  recent advancements on pose *canonicalization* as a suitable information extractor
  for this purpose. Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous
  shifts and against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating
  geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric shifts
  while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.
