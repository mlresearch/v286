title: Efficient Algorithms for Logistic Contextual Slate Bandits with Bandit Feedback
abstract: We study the Logistic Contextual Slate Bandit problem, where, at each round,
  an agent selects a slate of $N$ items from an exponentially large set (of size $2^{\Omega(N)}$)
  of candidate slates provided by the environment. A single binary reward, determined
  by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen slate. Our objective is to develop
  algorithms that maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds while maintaining low
  per-round computational costs. We propose two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS,
  that accomplish this goal. These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity
  via local planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global
  learning (joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence
  supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove that
  Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive experiments across
  a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
  outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both the lowest regret and the
  fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to select in-context examples
  in prompts of Language Models for solving binary classification tasks such as sentiment
  analysis. Our approach achieves competitive test accuracy, making it a viable alternative
  in practical scenarios.
