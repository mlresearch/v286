title: 'FDR-SVM: A Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine via a
  Mixture of Wasserstein Balls Ambiguity Set'
abstract: We study a federated classification problem over a network of multiple clients
  and a central server, in which each clientâ€™s local data remains private and is subject
  to uncertainty in both the features and labels. To address these uncertainties,
  we develop a novel Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine (FDR-SVM),
  robustifying the classification boundary against perturbations in local data distributions.
  Specifically, the data at each client is governed by a unique true distribution
  that is unknown. To handle this heterogeneity, we develop a novel Mixture of Wasserstein
  Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set, naturally extending the classical Wasserstein ball to
  the federated setting. We then establish theoretical guarantees for our proposed
  MoWB, deriving an out-of-sample performance bound and showing that its design preserves
  the separability of the FDR-SVM optimization problem. Next, we rigorously derive
  two algorithms that solve the FDR-SVM problem and analyze their convergence behavior
  as well as their worst-case time complexity. We evaluate our algorithms on industrial
  data and various UCI datasets, whereby we demonstrate that they frequently outperform
  existing state-of-the-art approaches.
