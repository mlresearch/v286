title: 'SALSA: A Secure, Adaptive and Label-Agnostic Scalable Algorithm for Machine
  Unlearning'
abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has simplified access to powerful
  machine learning models but faces challenges in complying with the “right to be
  forgotten” while resisting adversarial threats. Machine Unlearning (MU) addresses
  these issues by enabling selective data removal from models. However, existing methods
  are slow, label-dependent, vulnerable to black-box attacks, and computationally
  impractical for large-scale MLaaS deployments. We introduce SALSA, a Secure, Adaptive,
  Label-Agnostic, Scalable Algorithm for efficient and robust machine unlearning tailored
  to classification tasks in MLaaS. SALSA redistributes the class-wise predicted probabilities
  of data to be forgotten and optimizes a novel loss function that minimizes the divergence
  between redistributed and predicted probabilities while anchoring model parameters
  near their initialization. This ensures simultaneous unlearning and generalization.
  SALSA requires neither labels nor access to the remaining data, making it ideal
  for MLaaS environments. It is exceptionally fast, achieving at least $25\times$
  faster unlearning, on average, than the fastest baseline, while consistently outperforming
  five state-of-the-art MU techniques across eight metrics on benchmark datasets.
  Experiments on synthetic data show that SALSA’s altered decision boundaries closely
  approximate exact unlearning. Rigorous evaluations against state-of-the-art black-box
  attacks demonstrate its resilience to security threats. Thus, SALSA redefines practical
  machine unlearning, offering a scalable and resilient solution for safeguarding
  privacy in modern MLaaS systems.
