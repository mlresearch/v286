title: 'Beyond Sin-Squared Error: Linear Time Entrywise Uncertainty Quantification
  for Streaming PCA'
abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal
  component analysis (PCA) using Ojaâ€™s algorithm, enabling the construction of confidence
  intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most existing works
  on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error guarantees. Recently,
  there has been some interest in uncertainty quantification for the sin-squared error.
  However, uncertainty quantification or sharp error guarantees for _entries of the
  estimated eigenvector_ in the streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive
  a sharp Bernstein-type concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector
  matching the optimal error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central
  Limit Theorem for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently
  estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent subsampling
  algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically achieving similar
  accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being significantly more computationally
  efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in providing reliable
  uncertainty estimates with a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods.
