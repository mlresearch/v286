title: Pure and Strong Nash Equilibrium Computation in Compactly Representable Aggregate
  Games
abstract: Aggregate games model interdependent decision making when an agent’s utility
  depends on their own choice and the aggregation of everyone’s choices. We define
  a compactly representable subclass of aggregate games we call additive aggregate
  games, which encompasses popular games like congestion games, anonymous games, Schelling
  games, etc. We study computational questions on pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) and
  pure strong Nash equilibrium (SNE). We show that PNE existence is NP-complete for
  very simple cases of additive aggregate games. We devise an efficient algorithmic
  scheme for deciding the existence of a PNE and computing one (if it exists) for
  bounded aggregate space. We also give an approximation algorithm for a special type
  of additive aggregate games. For SNE, we show that SNE recognition is co-NP-complete
  and SNE existence is $\Sigma^P_2$-complete, even for simple types of additive aggregate
  games. For broad classes, we provide several novel and efficient aggregate-space
  algorithms for recognizing an SNE and deciding the existence of an SNE. Finally,
  we connect our results to several popular classes of games and show how our computational
  schemes can shed new light on these games.
