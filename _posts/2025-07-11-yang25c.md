title: 'MSCGrapher: Learning Multi-Scale Dynamic Correlations for Multivariate Time
  Series Forecasting'
abstract: 'Efficient learning intra-series and inter-series correlations is essential
  for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, in real-world scenarios,
  persistent and significant inter-series correlations are challenging to be represented
  in a static way and the strength of correlations varies across different time scales.
  In this paper, we address this challenge by modeling the complex inter-series relationships
  through dynamical correlations, considering the varying strengths of correlations.
  We propose a novel MTSF model: MSCGrapher, which leverages an adaptive correlation
  learning block to uncover inter-series correlations across different scales. Concretely,
  time series are first decomposed into different scales based on their periodicities.
  The graph representation of MTS is then constructed and an adaptive correlation
  learning method is introduced to capture the inter-series correlations across different
  scales. To quantify the strength of these correlations, we compute correlation scores
  based on the characteristics of the graph edges and classify correlations as either
  $\textit{Strong}$ or $\textit{Weak}$. Finally, we employ a self-attention module
  to capture intra-series correlations and then fuse features from all scales to obtain
  the final representation. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets show that
  MSCGrapher gains significant forecasting performance, highlighting the critical
  role of inter-series correlations in capturing implicit patterns for MTS.'
