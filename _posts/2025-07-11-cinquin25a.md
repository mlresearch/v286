title: Well-Defined Function-Space Variational Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks
  via Regularized KL-Divergence
abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNN) promise to combine the predictive performance
  of neural networks with principled uncertainty modeling crucial for safety-critical
  systems and decision making. However, posterior uncertainties depend on the choice
  of prior, and finding informative priors in weight-space has proven difficult. This
  has motivated variational inference (VI) methods that pose priors directly on the
  function represented by the BNN rather than on weights. In this paper, we address
  a fundamental issue with such function-space VI approaches pointed out by Burt et
  al. (2020), who showed that the objective function (ELBO) is negative infinite for
  most priors of interest. Our solution builds on generalized VI with the regularized
  KL divergence and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first well-defined variational
  objective for inference in BNNs with Gaussian process (GP) priors. Experiments show
  that our method successfully incorporates the properties specified by the GP prior,
  and that it provides competitive uncertainty estimates for regression, classification
  and out-of-distribution detection compared to BNN baselines with both function and
  weight-space priors.
