title: 'Dynamic Maintenance of Kernel Density Estimation Data Structure: From Practice
  to Theory'
abstract: 'Kernel density estimation (KDE) stands out as a challenging task in machine
  learning. The problem is defined in the following way: given a kernel function $f(x,y)$
  and a set of points $\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n \} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we would
  like to compute $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i,y)$ for any query point $y \in
  \mathbb{R}^d$. Recently, there has been a growing trend of using data structures
  for efficient KDE. However, the proposed KDE data structures focus on static settings.
  The robustness of KDE data structures over dynamic changing data distributions is
  not addressed. In this work, we focus on the dynamic maintenance of KDE data structures
  with robustness to adversarial queries. Especially, we provide a theoretical framework
  of KDE data structures. In our framework, the KDE data structures only require subquadratic
  spaces. Moreover, our data structure supports the dynamic update of the dataset
  in sublinear time. Furthermore, we can perform adaptive queries with the potential
  adversary in sublinear time.'
