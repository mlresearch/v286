title: 'DyGMAE: A Novel Dynamic Graph Masked Autoencoder for Link Prediction'
abstract: Dynamic link prediction (DLP) is a crucial task in graph learning, aiming
  to predict future links between nodes at subsequent time in dynamic graphs. Recently,
  graph masked autoencoders (GMAEs) have shown promising performance in self-supervised
  learning. However, their application to DLP is under-explored. Existing GMAEs struggle
  to capture temporal dependencies, and their random masking causes crucial information
  loss for DLP. Moreover, most existing DLP methods rely on local information, ignoring
  global information and failing to capture complex features in real-world dynamic
  graphs. To address these issues, we propose DyGMAE, a novel dynamic GMAE method
  specifically designed for DLP. DyGMAE introduces a Multi-Scale Masking Strategy
  (MSMS), which generates multiple graph views by masking parts of the edges and tries
  to reconstruct them. Additionally, a multi-scale masking representation alignment
  module with a contrastive learning objective is employed to align representations
  which are encoded by unmasked edges across these views. Through this design, different
  masked views can provide diverse information to alleviate the drawbacks of random
  masking, and contrastive learning can align different views to mitigate the problem
  of exploiting local and global information simultaneously. Experiments on benchmark
  datasets show DyGMAE achieves superior performance in the DLP task.
