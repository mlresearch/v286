title: Moments of Causal Effects
abstract: The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for
  characterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics such
  as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product moments, including
  covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between multiple random variables.
  On the other hand, the primary focus of causal inference is the evaluation of causal
  effects, which are defined as the difference between two potential outcomes. While
  traditional causal effect assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this
  work provides definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product
  moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We conduct
  experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal effects from finite
  samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world medical dataset.
