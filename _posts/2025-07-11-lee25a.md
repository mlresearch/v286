title: Constraint-based Causal Discovery from a Collection of Conditioning Sets
abstract: 'In constraint-based causal discovery, the existing algorithms systematically
  use a series of conditional independence (CI) relations observed in the data to
  recover an equivalence class of causal graphs in the large sample limit. One limitation
  of these algorithms is that CI tests lose statistical power as conditioning set
  size increases with finite samples. Recent research proposes to limit the conditioning
  set size for robust causal discovery. However, the existing algorithms require exhaustive
  testing of all CI relations with conditioning set sizes up to a certain integer
  $k$. This becomes problematic in practice when variables with large support are
  present, as it makes CI tests less reliable due to near-deterministic relationships,
  thereby violating the faithfulness assumption. To address this issue, we propose
  a causal discovery algorithm that only uses CI tests where the conditioning sets
  are restricted to a given set of conditioning sets including the empty set $\mathcal{C}$.
  We call such set of CI relations ${\mathcal{I}}_{\mathcal{C}}$ conditionally closed.
  We define the notion of $\mathcal{C}$-Markov equivalence: two causal graphs are
  $\mathcal{C}$-Markov equivalent if they entail the same set of CI constraints from
  ${\mathcal{I}}_\mathcal{C}$. We propose a graphical representation of $\mathcal{C}$-Markov
  equivalence and characterize such equivalence between two causal graphs. Our proposed
  algorithm called the $\mathcal{C}$-PC algorithm is sound for learning the $\mathcal{C}$-Markov
  equivalence class. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm via synthetic
  and real-world experiments in scenarios where variables with large support or high
  correlation are present in the data.'
