title: Towards Provably Efficient Learning of Imperfect Information Extensive-Form
  Games with Linear Function Approximation
abstract: Despite significant advances in learning imperfect information extensive-form
  games (IIEFGs), most existing theoretical guarantees are limited to IIEFGs in the
  tabular case. To permit efficient learning of large-scale IIEFGs, we take the first
  step in studying two-player zero-sum IIEFGs with linear function approximation.
  In particular, we consider linear IIEFGs in the formulation of partially observable
  Markov games (POMGs) with linearly parameterized rewards. To address the challenge
  that the underlying function approximation structure is difficult to directly apply
  due to the imperfect information of states, we construct the composite "feature
  vectors" for information set-action pairs. Based on this, we further propose a "least-squares
  loss estimator", which we call the *fictitious* least-squares loss estimator. Through
  integrating this estimator with the follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) framework,
  we propose the *fictitious* least-squares follow-the-regularized-leader ($\text{F}^2\text{TRL}$)
  algorithm, which achieves a provable $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\lambda\sqrt{d H^2
  T})$ regret guarantee in the large $T$ regime, where $d$ is the ambient dimension
  of the feature mapping, $H$ is the horizon length, $\lambda$ is a "balance coefficient"
  and $T$ is the number of episodes. At the core of the analysis of $\text{F}^2\text{TRL}$
  is the leverage of our proposed new "balanced transition" over information set-action
  space. Additionally, we complement our results with an $\Omega(\sqrt{d\min(d,H)T})$
  regret lower bound for this problem and conduct empirical evaluations across various
  environments, which corroborate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
