title: Best Arm Identification with Possibly Biased Offline Data
abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased
  offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in real-world
  scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result for adaptive
  algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between online and offline
  distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H algorithm, which introduces
  adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an auxiliary bias correction to balance
  offline and online data within the LUCB framework. Theoretical analysis shows that
  LUCB-H matches the sample complexity of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading
  and significantly outperforms it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an
  instance-dependent lower bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain
  scenarios. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability
  of LUCB-H in effectively incorporating offline data.
