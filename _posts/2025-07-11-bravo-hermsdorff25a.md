title: Causal Models for Growing Networks
abstract: Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability
  are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the *distribution*
  of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the *causal structure*
  between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models
  over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral
  sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes
  with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these
  classes are remarkably amenable to parallelization. As an example, we highlight
  a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent
  phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters
  and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline
  models for causal inference in relational data.
