title: Learning to Sample in Stochastic Optimization
abstract: We consider a PAC-Bayes analysis of stochastic optimization algorithms,
  and devise a new SGDA algorithm inspired from our bounds. Our algorithm learns a
  data-dependent sampling scheme along with model parameters, which may be seen as
  assigning a probability to each training point. We demonstrate that learning the
  sampling scheme increases robustness against misleading training points, as our
  algorithm learns to avoid bad examples during training. We conduct experiments in
  both standard and adversarial learning problems on several benchmark datasets, and
  demonstrate various applications including interpretability upon visual inspection,
  and robustness to the ill effects of bad training points. We also extend our analysis
  to pairwise SGD to demonstrate the generalizability of our methodology.
