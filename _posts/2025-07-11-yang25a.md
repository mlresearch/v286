title: Full Network Capacity Framework for Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the presence of dormant neurons leads
  to a significant reduction in network capacity, which results in sub-optimal performance
  and limited sample efficiency. Existing training techniques, especially those relying
  on periodic resetting (PR), exacerbate this issue. We propose the Full Network Capacity
  (FNC) framework based on PR, which consists of two novel modules: Dormant Neuron
  Reactivation (DNR) and Stable Policy Update (SPU). DNR continuously reactivates
  dormant neurons, thereby enhancing network capacity. SPU mitigates perturbation
  from DNR and PR and stabilizes the Q-values for the actor, ensuring smooth training
  and reliable policy updates. Our experimental evaluations on the Atari 100K and
  DMControl 100K benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable sample efficiency of FNC. On
  Atari 100K, FNC achieves a superhuman IQM HNS of 107.3%, outperforming the previous
  state-of-the-art method BBF by 13.3%. On DMControl 100K, FNC excels in 5 out of
  6 tasks in terms of episodic return and attains the highest median and mean aggregated
  scores. FNC not only maximizes network capacity but also provides a practical solution
  for real-world applications where data collection is costly and time-consuming.
  Our implementation is publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/tlyy/FNC}.'
