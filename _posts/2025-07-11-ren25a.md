title: 'COS-DPO: Conditioned One-Shot Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning Framework'
abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the *Multi-Objective
  Fine-Tuning* (MOFT) problem, *i.e.*, fine-tuning an existing model with datasets
  labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we
  propose a *Conditioned One-Shot* fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the
  Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM
  alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning
  on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient
  one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving
  comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our
  theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function,
  we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature
  parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control
  over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to
  various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting
  its viability for large-scale ML deployments.
