title: Computationally Efficient Methods for Invariant Feature Selection with Sparsity
abstract: Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) (Arjovsky et al., 2020) proposes an optimization
  scheme that uses causal features to improve generalization. However, in most realizations,
  it does not have an explicit feature selection strategy. Prior investigation (Rosenfeld
  et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023) reveals failure cases when searching for causal
  features, and in light of these concerns, recent work has demonstrated the promise
  of using sparsity (Zhou et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2024) in IRM, and we make two
  specific contributions on that theme. First, for the original sparse IRM formulation,
  we present the first correct non-asymptotic analysis of the effectiveness of sparsity
  for selecting invariant features. We show that sparse IRM with $L_0$ constraints
  can select invariant features and ignore spurious and random features. We show that
  sample complexity depends polynomially on the number of invariant features and otherwise
  logarithmically on the ambient dimensionality. Second, we present the first invariant
  feature recovery guarantees with a computationally-efficient implementation of such
  sparse IRM based on iterative hard thresholding. Prior methods are limited to combinatorially
  searching over the space of all sparse models, but we present a different loss function.
  We show this new optimization implies recovery of invariant features under standard
  assumptions. We present empirical results on standard benchmark datasets to demonstrate
  the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed sparse IRM models.
