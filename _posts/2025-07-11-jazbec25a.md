title: Generative Uncertainty in Diffusion Models
abstract: Diffusion models have recently driven significant breakthroughs in generative
  modeling. While state-of-the-art models produce high-quality samples on average,
  individual samples can still be low quality. Detecting such samples without human
  inspection remains a challenging task. To address this, we propose a Bayesian framework
  for estimating generative uncertainty of synthetic samples. We outline how to make
  Bayesian inference practical for large, modern generative models and introduce a
  new semantic likelihood (evaluated in the latent space of a feature extractor) to
  address the challenges posed by high-dimensional sample spaces. Through our experiments,
  we demonstrate that the proposed generative uncertainty effectively identifies poor-quality
  samples and significantly outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods. Notably,
  our Bayesian framework can be applied post-hoc to any pretrained diffusion or flow
  matching model (via the Laplace approximation), and we propose simple yet effective
  techniques to minimize its computational overhead during sampling.
