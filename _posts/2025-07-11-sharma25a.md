title: Learning Robust XGBoost Ensembles for Regression Tasks
abstract: Methods to improve the adversarial robustness of tree-based ensemble models
  for classification tasks have received significant attention in recent years. In
  this work, we propose a novel method for training robust tree-based boosted ensembles
  applicable to any task that employs a differentiable loss function, leveraging the
  XGBoost framework. Our work introduces an analytical solution to the upper-bound
  of the robust loss function, that can be computed in constant time, enabling the
  construction of robust splits without sacrificing computational efficiency. Although
  our method is general, we focus its application on regression tasks, extending conventional
  regression metrics to better quantify model robustness. An extensive evaluation
  on 19 regression datasets from a widely-used tabular data benchmark demonstrates
  that in the face of adversarial perturbations in the input space, our proposed method
  results in ensembles that are up to 44% more robust compared to the present SoA
  and 113% more robust than the conventional XGBoost model when considering norm bounded
  attacks of radius 0.05.
