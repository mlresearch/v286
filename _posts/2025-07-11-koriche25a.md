title: Probabilistic Explanations for Regression Models
abstract: Formal explainability is an emerging field that aims to provide mathematically
  guaranteed explanations for the predictions made by machine learning models. Recent
  work in this area focuses on computing “probabilistic explanations” for the predictions
  made by classifiers based on specific data instances. The goal of this paper is
  to extend the concept of probabilistic explanations to the regression setting, treating
  the target regressor as a black box function. The class of probabilistic explanations
  consists of linear functions that meet a sparsity constraint, alongside a hyperplane
  constraint defined for the data instance being explained. While minimizing the precision
  error of such explanations is generally $\text{NP}^{\text{PP}}$-hard, we demonstrate
  that it can be approximated by substituting the precision measure with a fidelity
  measure. Optimal explanations based on this fidelity objective can be effectively
  approached using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). Moreover, we show that for certain
  distributions used to define the precision measure, explanations with approximation
  guarantees can be computed in polynomial time using a variant of Iterative Hard
  Thresholding (IHT). Experiments conducted on various datasets indicate that both
  the MIP and IHT approaches outperform the state-of-the-art LIME and MAPLE explainers.
