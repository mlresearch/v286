title: Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic
  Noise
abstract: We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant
  (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. The state-of-the-art guarantees that the system
  is stabilized before the system state reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$ in $L^2$-norm, where
  $n$ is the state dimension, and $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. However,
  this bound only holds in *noiseless* LTI systems that have a control input dimension
  at least as large as the dimension of unstable subspace, making it impractical in
  many real-life scenarios. In noisy systems, unknown noise is not only amplified
  by unstable system modes but also imposes significant difficulty in estimating the
  system dynamics or bounding the estimation errors. Furthermore, the aforementioned
  complexity is only achievable when the system has a number of control inputs that
  are at least as many as the dimension of the unstable subspace. To address these
  issues, we develop a novel algorithm with a singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based
  analytical framework and show that the system is stabilized with the same complexity
  guarantee with the state-of-the-art in a noisy environment. With the SVD-based framework,
  we can bound the error of system identification with Davis-Kahan Theorem and design
  a controller that does not require the invertibility of the control matrix, making
  it possible to apply this algorithm in under-actuated settings. To the best of our
  knowledge, this paper is the first to achieve learning-to-stabilize unknown LTI
  system without exponential blow-up in noisy and under-actuated systems. We further
  demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm in under-actuated settings.
