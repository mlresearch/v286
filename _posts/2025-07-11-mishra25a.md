title: 'ODD: Overlap-aware Estimation of Model Performance under Distribution Shift'
abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
  domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses \textit{disagreement
  discrepancy} (\disdis) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts.
  It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound
  the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable
  and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in
  this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in
  the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption
  that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the
  overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement
  Discrepancy (\odd). Our \odd-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap
  and better predicts target performance than \disdis. We conduct experiments on a
  wide array of benchmarks to show that our method improves the overall performance-estimation
  error while remaining valid and reliable. Our code and results are available on
