title: Correlated Quantization for Faster Nonconvex Distributed Optimization
abstract: Quantization [Alistarh et al., 2017] is an important (stochastic) compression
  technique that reduces the volume of transmitted bits during each communication
  round in distributed model training. Suresh et al. [2022] introduce correlated quantizers
  and show their advantages over independent counterparts by analyzing distributed
  SGD communication complexity. We analyze the fore- front distributed non-convex
  optimization algorithm MARINA [Gorbunov et al., 2022] utilizing the proposed correlated
  quantizers and show that it outperforms the original MARINA and distributed SGD
  of Suresh et al. [2022] with regard to the communication complexity. We significantly
  re- fine the original analysis of MARINA without any additional assumptions using
  the weighted Hessian variance [Tyurin et al., 2022], and then we expand the theoretical
  framework of MARINA to accommodate a substantially broader range of potentially
  correlated and biased compressors, thus dilating the applicability of the method
  beyond the conventional independent unbiased compressor setup. Extensive experimental
  results corroborate our theoretical findings.
