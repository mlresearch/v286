title: Probability-Raising Causality for Uncertain Parametric Markov Decision Processes
  with PAC Guarantees
abstract: Recent decision-making systems are increasingly complicated, making it crucial
  to verify and understand their behavior for a given specification. A promising approach
  is to comprehensively explain undesired behavior in the systems modeled by Markov
  decision processes (MDPs) through formal verification and causal reasoning. However,
  the reliable explanation using model-based probabilistic causal analysis has not
  been explored when the MDPâ€™s transition probabilities are uncertain. This paper
  proposes a method to identify potential causes of undesired behaviors in an uncertain
  parametric MDP (upMDP) using parameter sampling, model checking, and a set covering
  for the samples. A cause is defined as a subset of states based on a probability-raising
  principle. We show that the probability of each identified subset being a cause
  exceeds a specified threshold. Further, a lower bound of the probability that the
  undesired paths visit the subsets is maximized as much as possible while satisfying
  a nonredundancy condition. While computing these probabilities is complicated, this
  study derives probabilistically approximately correct lower bounds of both probabilities
  by the sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through
  a path-planning scenario.
