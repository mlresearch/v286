title: Relational Causal Discovery with Latent Confounders
abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
  when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While several
  causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with latent confounders
  from data, they assume that the data is independent and identically distributed
  (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from relational data. Similarly, existing
  relational causal discovery algorithms assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic
  for many real-world datasets. To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and
  complete causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders.
  Our work builds upon the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery
  (RCD) algorithms and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal
  discovery in relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees
  for relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental results
  demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct causal structure
  in relational causal models with latent confounders.
