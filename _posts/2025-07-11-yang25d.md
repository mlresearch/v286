title: Flow-Based Delayed Hawkes Process
abstract: 'Multivariate Hawkes processes are classic temporal point process models
  for event data. These models are simple and parametric in nature, offering interpretability
  by capturing the triggering effects between event types. However, these parametric
  models often struggle with low model capacity, limiting their expressive power to
  capture heterogeneous data patterns influenced by latent variables. In this paper,
  we propose a simple yet powerful extension: the Flow-based Delayed Hawkes Process,
  which integrates Normalizing Flows as a generative model to parameterize the Hawkes
  process. By generating all model parameters through the flow-based network, our
  approach significantly improves flexibility and expressiveness while preserving
  interpretability. We provide theoretical guarantees by proving the identifiability
  of the model parameters and the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator
  under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
  show that our model outperforms existing baselines in capturing intricate and heterogeneous
  event dynamics.'
