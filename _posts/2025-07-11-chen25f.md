title: 'Moment Alignment: Unifying Gradient and Hessian Matching for Domain Generalization'
abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks to develop models that generalize well
  to unseen target domains, addressing distribution shifts in real-world applications.
  One line of research in DG focuses on aligning domain-level gradients and Hessians
  to enhance generalization. However, existing methods are computationally inefficient
  and the underlying principles of these approaches are not well understood. In this
  paper, we develop a theory of moment alignment for DG. Grounded in transfer measures,
  a principled framework for quantifying generalizability between domains, we prove
  that aligning derivatives across domains improves transfer measures. Moment alignment
  provides a unifying understanding of Invariant Risk Minimization, gradient matching,
  and Hessian matching, three previously disconnected approaches. We further establish
  the duality between feature moments and derivatives of the classifier head. Building
  upon our theory, we introduce Closed-Form Moment Alignment (CMA), a novel DG algorithm
  that aligns domain-level gradients and Hessians in closed-form. Our method overcomes
  the computational inefficiencies of existing gradient and Hessian-based techniques
  by eliminating the need for repeated backpropagation or sampling-based Hessian estimation.
  We validate our theory and algorithm through quantitative and qualitative experiments.
