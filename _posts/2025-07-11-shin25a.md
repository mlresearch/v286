title: Critical Influence of Overparameterization on Sharpness-aware Minimization
abstract: Training overparameterized neural networks often yields solutions with varying
  generalization capabilities, even when achieving similar training losses. Recent
  evidence indicates a strong correlation between the sharpness of a minimum and its
  generalization error, leading to increased interest in optimization methods that
  explicitly seek flatter minima for improved generalization. Despite its contemporary
  relevance to overparameterization, however, this sharpness-aware minimization (SAM)
  strategy has not been studied much yet as to exactly how it is affected by overparameterization.
  In this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization, presenting
  both empirical and theoretical findings that reveal its critical influence on SAMâ€™s
  effectiveness. First, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse
  domains and show that SAM consistently improves with overparameterization. Next,
  we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution space
  and increased implicit bias resulting from overparameterization. Furthermore, we
  show that this effect is particularly pronounced in practical settings involving
  label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization is necessary. Last
  but not least, we provide other theoretical insights into how overparameterization
  helps SAM achieve minima with more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD, and
  much faster convergence at a linear rate.
