title: 'On the Privacy Risks of Spiking Neural Networks: A Membership Inference Analysis'
abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy
  efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain
  largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership
  Inference Attacks (MIAs)-a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine
  whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests
  that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature,
  we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we
  introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly
  enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that
  SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better,
  our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable
  to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
