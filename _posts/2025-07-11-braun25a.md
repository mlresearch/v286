title: Stein Variational Evolution Strategies
abstract: Efficient global optimization and sampling are fundamental challenges, particularly
  in fields such as robotics and reinforcement learning, where gradients may be unavailable
  or unreliable. In this context, jointly optimizing multiple solutions is a promising
  approach to avoid local optima. While Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)
  provides a powerful framework for sampling diverse solutions, its reliance on first-order
  information limits its applicability to differentiable objectives. Existing gradient-free
  SVGD variants often suffer from slow convergence, and poor scalability. To improve
  gradient-free sampling and optimization, we propose Stein Variational CMA-ES, a
  novel gradient-free SVGD-like method that combines the efficiency of evolution strategies
  with SVGD-based repulsion forces. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation across
  several domains, which shows that the integration of the ES update in SVGD significantly
  improves the performance on multiple challenging benchmark problems. Our findings
  establish SV-CMA-ES as a scalable method for zero-order sampling and blackbox optimization,
  bridging the gap between SVGD and evolution strategies.
