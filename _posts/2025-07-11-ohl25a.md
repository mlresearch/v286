title: Discriminative ordering through ensemble consensus
abstract: Evaluating the performance of clustering models is a challenging task where
  the outcome depends on the definition of what constitutes a cluster. Due to this
  design, current existing metrics rarely handle multiple clustering models with diverse
  cluster definitions, nor do they comply with the integration of constraints when
  available. In this work, we take inspiration from consensus clustering and assume
  that a set of clustering models is able to uncover hidden structures in the data.
  We propose to construct a discriminative ordering through ensemble clustering based
  on the distance between the connectivity of a clustering model and the consensus
  matrix. We first validate the proposed method with synthetic scenarios, highlighting
  that the proposed score ranks the models that best match the consensus first. We
  then show that this simple ranking score significantly outperforms other scoring
  methods when comparing sets of different clustering algorithms that are not restricted
  to a fixed number of clusters and is compatible with clustering constraints.
