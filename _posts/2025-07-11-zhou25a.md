title: Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage via Poisoning Attack in Offline
  Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of pre-collected
  data over the target policyâ€™s distribution. Existing studies aim to improve data-policy
  coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook security risks from insufficient
  coverage, and the single-step analysis is not consistent with the multi-step decision-making
  nature of offline RL. To address this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability
  coefficient to quantify coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the
  upper bound of estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this,
  we propose the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning
  attack. Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
  pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that capture
  multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause insufficient coverage,
  and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate distributional shifts. Experiments
  show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset can degrade agent performance by 90%.
  This finding provides new perspectives for analyzing and safeguarding the security
  of offline RL.
