title: Optimal Zero-shot Regret Minimization for Selective Classification with Out-of-Distribution
  Detection
abstract: Selective Classification with Out-of-Distribution Detection (SCOD) is a
  general framework that combines the detection of incorrectly classified in-distribution
  samples and out-of-distribution samples. Previous solutions for SCOD heavily rely
  on the choice of Selective Classification (SC) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detectors
  selected at test time. Notably, the performance of these detectors varies across
  different underlying data distributions. Hence, a poor choice can affect the efficacy
  of the SCOD framework. On the other hand, making an informed choice is impossible
  without samples from both in- and out-distribution. We propose an optimal zero-shot
  black-box method for SCOD that aggregates off-the-shelf detectors, is based on the
  principle of regret minimization, and therefore provides guarantees on the worst-case
  performance. We demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
  methods in several benchmarks while also shielding the user from the burden of blindly
  selecting the SC and OOD detectors, optimally reducing the worst-case rejection
  risk.
