title: Partial-Label Learning with Conformal Candidate Cleaning
abstract: Real-world data is often ambiguous; for example, human annotation produces
  instances with multiple conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning (PLL) aims
  at training a classifier in this challenging setting, where each instance is associated
  with a set of candidate labels and one correct, but unknown, class label. A multitude
  of algorithms targeting this setting exists and, to enhance their prediction quality,
  several extensions that are applicable across a wide range of PLL methods have been
  introduced. While many of these extensions rely on heuristics, this article proposes
  a novel enhancing method that incrementally prunes candidate sets using conformal
  prediction. To work around the missing labeled validation set, which is typically
  required for conformal prediction, we propose a strategy that alternates between
  training a PLL classifier to label the validation set, leveraging these predicted
  class labels for calibration, and pruning candidate labels that are not part of
  the resulting conformal sets. In this sense, our method alternates between empirical
  risk minimization and candidate set pruning. We establish that our pruning method
  preserves the conformal validity with respect to the unknown ground truth. Our extensive
  experiments on artificial and real-world data show that the proposed approach significantly
  improves the test set accuracies of several state-of-the-art PLL classifiers.
