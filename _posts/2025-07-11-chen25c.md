title: Adaptive Threshold Sampling for Pure Exploration in Submodular Bandits
abstract: We address the problem of submodular maximization under bandit feedback,
  where the objective function $f:2^U\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ can only be accessed
  through noisy, i.i.d. sub-Gaussian queries. This problem arises in many applications
  including influence maximization, diverse recommendation systems, and large-scale
  facility location optimization. In this paper, we focus on the pure-exploration
  setting, where the goal is to identify a high-quality solution set using as few
  noisy queries as possible. We propose an efficient adaptive sampling strategy, called
  Confident Sample (CS) that can serve as a versatile subroutine to propose approximation
  algorithms for many submodular maximization problems. Our algorithms achieve approximation
  guarantees arbitrarily close to the standard value oracle setting and are highly
  sample-efficient. We propose and analyze algorithms for monotone submodular maximization
  with cardinality and matroid constraints, as well as unconstrained non-monotone
  submodular maximization. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical evaluation
  on real instances, demonstrating the superior sample efficiency of our proposed
  algorithm relative to alternative approaches.
