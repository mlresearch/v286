title: Causal Eligibility Traces for Confounding Robust Off-Policy Evaluation
abstract: A unifying theme in Artificial Intelligence is learning an effective policy
  to control an agent in an unknown environment in order to optimize a certain performance
  measure. Off-policy methods can significantly improve sample efficiency during training,
  since they allow an agent to learn from observed trajectories generated by different
  behavior policies, without directly deploying target policies in the underlying
  environment. This paper studies off-policy evaluation from biased offline data where
  (1) unobserved confounding bias cannot be ruled out a priori; or (2) the observed
  trajectories do not overlap with intended behaviors of the learner, i.e., the target
  and behavior policies do not share a common support. Specifically, we extend Bellmanâ€™s
  equation to derive effective closed-form bounds over value functions from the observational
  distribution contaminated with unobserved confounding and no overlap. Second, we
  propose two novel algorithms that use eligibility traces to estimate these bounds
  from finite observational data. Compared to other methods for robust off-policy
  evaluation in sequential environments, these methods are model-free and extend,
  for the first time, the well-celebrated temporal difference algorithms (Sutton,
  1988) to biased offline data with unobserved confounding and no overlap.
