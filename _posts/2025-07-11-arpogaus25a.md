title: Hybrid Bernstein Normalizing Flows for Flexible Multivariate Density Regression
  with Interpretable Marginals
abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by
  modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible estimation
  approaches such as normalizing flows (NFs) work particularly well in multiple dimensions,
  interpreting the input-output relationship of such models is often difficult, due
  to the black-box character of deep learning models. In contrast, existing statistical
  methods for multivariate outcomes such as multivariate conditional transformation
  models (MCTMs) are restricted in flexibility and are often not expressive enough
  to represent complex multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine
  MCTMs with state-of-the-art and autoregressive NFs to leverage the transparency
  of MCTMs for modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions
  in the first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NFs techniques to
  account for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution.
  We demonstrate our method’s versatility in various numerical experiments and compare
  it with MCTMs and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.
