title: Nonparametric Bayesian Multi-Facet Clustering for Longitudinal Data
abstract: Complex real-world time series data are inherently multi-faceted, e.g.,
  temporal data can be described by seasonality and trend. Popular clustering methods
  typically aggregate information from all facets, treating them collectively rather
  than individually. This aggregation may diminish the interpretability of clusters
  by obscuring the specific contributions of individual facets to the clustering outcome.
  This limitation can be addressed by multi-facet clustering that builds a separate
  clustering model for each facet simultaneously. In this paper, we explore Bayesian
  multi-facet clustering modelling for temporal data using nonparametric priors to
  select an appropriate number of clusters automatically and using variational inference
  to efficiently explore the parameter space. We apply this framework to nonlinear
  growth models and vector autoregressive models and observe their performance through
  simulation studies. We apply these models to real-world time series data from the
  English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), highlighting its utility in identifying
  meaningful and interpretable clusters. These findings underscore the potential of
  the framework for advancing the analysis of multi-faceted longitudinal data in diverse
  fields. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/Demi-wlw/Nonparametric-Bayesian-Multi-Facet-Clustering-for-Longitudinal-Data.git}{GitHub}.
