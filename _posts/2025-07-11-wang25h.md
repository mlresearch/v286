title: A Mirror Descent Perspective of Smoothed Sign Descent
abstract: The optimization dynamics of gradient descent for overparameterized problems
  can be viewed as low-dimensional dual dynamics induced by a mirror map, providing
  a mirror descent perspective on the implicit regularization phenomenon. However,
  the dynamics of adaptive gradient descent methods that are widely used in practice
  remain less understood. Meanwhile, empirical evidence of performance gaps suggests
  fundamental differences in their underlying dynamics. In this work, we introduce
  the dual dynamics of smoothed sign descent with stability constant $\varepsilon$
  for regression problems, formulated using the mirror descent framework. Unlike prior
  methods, our approach applies to algorithms where update directions deviate from
  true gradients such as ADAM. We propose a mirror map that reveals the equivalent
  dual dynamics under some assumptions. By studying dual dynamics, we characterize
  the convergent solution as approximately minimizing a Bregman divergence style function
  closely related to the $l_{3/2}$ norm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the role of the
  stability constant $\varepsilon$ in shaping the convergent solution. Our analyses
  offer new insights into the distinct properties of the smoothed sign descent algorithm,
  and show the potential of applying the mirror descent framework to study complex
  dynamics beyond gradient descent.
