title: 'MindFlayer SGD: Efficient Parallel SGD in the Presence of Heterogeneous and
  Random Worker Compute Times'
abstract: We investigate the problem of minimizing the expectation of smooth nonconvex
  functions in a distributed setting with multiple parallel workers that are able
  to compute stochastic gradients. A significant challenge in this context is the
  presence of arbitrarily heterogeneous and stochastic compute times among workers,
  which can severely degrade the performance of existing parallel stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) methods. While some parallel SGD algorithms achieve optimal performance
  under deterministic but heterogeneous delays, their effectiveness diminishes when
  compute times are random-a scenario not explicitly addressed in their design. To
  bridge this gap, we introduce MindFlayer SGD, a novel parallel SGD method specifically
  designed to handle stochastic and heterogeneous compute times. Through theoretical
  analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that MindFlayer SGD consistently
  outperforms existing baselines, particularly in environments with heavy-tailed noise.
  Our results highlight its robustness and scalability, making it a compelling choice
  for large-scale distributed learning tasks.
