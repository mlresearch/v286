title: Adapting Prediction Sets to Distribution Shifts Without Labels
abstract: Recently there has been a surge of interest to deploy confidence set predictions
  rather than point predictions in machine learning. Unfortunately, the effectiveness
  of such prediction sets is frequently impaired by distribution shifts in practice,
  and the challenge is often compounded by the lack of ground truth labels at test
  time. Focusing on a standard set-valued prediction framework called conformal prediction
  (CP), this paper studies how to improve its practical performance using only unlabeled
  data from the shifted test domain. This is achieved by two new methods called $\texttt{ECP}$
  and $\texttt{E{\small A}CP}$, whose main idea is to adjust the score function in
  CP according to its base modelâ€™s own uncertainty evaluation. Through extensive experiments
  on a number of large-scale datasets and neural network architectures, we show that
  our methods provide consistent improvement over existing baselines and nearly match
  the performance of fully supervised methods.
