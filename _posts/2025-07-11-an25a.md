title: Sparse Structure Exploration and Re-optimization for Vision Transformer
abstract: 'Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve outstanding performance by effectively
  capturing long-range dependencies between image patches (tokens). However, the high
  computational cost and memory requirements of ViTs present challenges for model
  compression and deployment on edge devices. In this study, we introduce a new framework,
  Sparse Structure Exploration and Re-optimization (SERo), specifically designed to
  maximize pruning efficiency in ViTs. Our approach focuses on (1) hardware-friendly
  pruning that fully compresses pruned parameters instead of zeroing them out, (2)
  separating the exploration and re-optimization phases \red{in order to find the
  optimal structure among various possible sparse structures}, and (3) using a simple
  gradient magnitude-based criterion for pruning a pre-trained model. SERo iteratively
  refines pruning masks to identify optimal sparse structures and then re-optimizes
  the pruned structure, reducing computational costs while maintaining model performance.
  Experimental results indicate that SERo surpasses existing pruning methods across
  various ViT models in both performance and computational efficiency. For example,
  SERo achieves a 69% reduction in computational cost and a 2.4x increase in processing
  speed for DeiT-Base model, with only a 1.55% drop in accuracy. Implementation code:
