title: 'FALCON: Adaptive Cross-Domain APT Attack Investigation  with Federated Causal
  Learning'
abstract: With the extensive deployment and application of Internet of Things (IoT)
  devices, vulnerable edge nodes have emerged as primary targets for Advanced Persistent
  Threat (APT) attacks. Attackers compromise IoT terminal devices to establish an
  initial foothold and subsequently exploit lateral movement techniques to progressively
  infiltrate core business networks. Prior investigation methods struggle with fragmented
  threat intelligence and sparse attack samples in heterogeneous audit logs, resulting
  in incomplete attack chain reconstruction and high false positives. We propose a
  novel approach to APT attack investigation, FALCON, which captures complex causal
  relationships between entities from discrete audit logs and constructs cross-domain
  provenance graphs, enabling rapid and accurate identification of potential APT activities.
  FALCON trains an adaptive edge-side local model with cross-domain behavior sequences
  containing extensive and remote contextual information, and employs a bidirectional
  transformer pre-trained model to learn latent representations from unlabeled sequences.
  To the best of our knowledge, FALCON is the first APT investigation method to conduct
  causal provenance based on cross-domain audit logs while ensuring privacy protection.
  The experimental results demonstrate that FALCON effectively detects APT attacks
  with accuracy 99.71% and reconstructs attack scenarios with accuracy 87.4%.
