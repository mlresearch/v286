title: Nonparametric Bayesian inference of item-level features in classifier combination
abstract: In classification tasks, examples belonging to the same class can often
  still differ substantially from one another, and being able to capture such heterogeneity
  and its impact on classification can be important for aggregating estimates across
  multiple classifiers. Bayesian models developed so far have relied on a fixed set
  of latent variables to model these causal factors, which not only introduces the
  need for model selection but also assumes that each item is governed by the same
  set of causal factors. We develop a Bayesian model that can infer generic item features
  by modeling item feature membership as distributed according to an Indian Buffet
  Process. Despite its flexibility, our model is scalable to a large number of classifiers
  and examples. We compare our method with models from item response theory and Bayesian
  classifier combination on black-box crowdsourcing tasks and with neural network
  instance-dependent models in white-box classifier combination tasks.
