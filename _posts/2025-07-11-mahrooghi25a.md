title: Multi-armed Bandits with Missing Outcomes
abstract: While significant progress has been made in designing algorithms that minimize
  regret in online decision-making, real-world scenarios often introduce additional
  complexities, with missing outcomes perhaps among the most challenging ones. Overlooking
  this aspect or simply assuming random missingness invariably leads to biased estimates
  of the rewards and may result in linear regret. Despite the practical relevance
  of this challenge, no rigorous methodology currently exists for systematically handling
  missingness, especially when the missingness mechanism is not random. In this paper,
  we address this gap in the context of multi-armed bandits (MAB) with missing outcomes
  by analyzing the impact of different missingness mechanisms on achievable regret
  bounds. We introduce algorithms that account for missingness under both missing
  at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) models. Through both analytical
  and simulation studies, we demonstrate the drastic improvements in decision-making
  by accounting for missingness in these settings.
