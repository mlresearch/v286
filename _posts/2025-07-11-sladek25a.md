title: Approximate Bayesian Inference via Bitstring Representations
abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
  low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
  probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by these
  representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous distribution using
  discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and quantized neural networks,
  where we introduce a tractable learning approach using probabilistic circuits. This
  method offers a scalable solution to manage complex distributions and provides clear
  insights into model behavior. We validate our approach with various models, demonstrating
  inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable,
  interpretable machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
  computations.
