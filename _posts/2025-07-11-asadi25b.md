title: Limit-sure Reachability for Small Memory Policies in POMDPs is NP-complete
abstract: A standard model that arises in several applications in sequential decision-making
  is partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) where a decision-making
  agent interacts with an uncertain environment. A basic objective in POMDPs is the
  reachability objective, where given a target set of states, the goal is to eventually
  arrive at one of them. The limit-sure problem asks whether reachability can be ensured
  with probability arbitrarily close to 1. In general, the limit-sure reachability
  problem for POMDPs is undecidable. However, in many practical cases, the most relevant
  question is the existence of policies with a small amount of memory. In this work,
  we study the limit-sure reachability problem for POMDPs with a fixed amount of memory.
  We establish that the computational complexity of the problem is NP-complete.
