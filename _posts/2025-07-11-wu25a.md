title: Online Generalized Magician’s Problem with Multiple Workers
abstract: We study the online Generalized Magician’s Problem with Multiple Workers
  (GMPMW), where tasks arrive sequentially and must be assigned to one of several
  workers for processing, with each worker consuming a stochastic amount of resources
  and generating an unknown reward. The system must decide on the acceptance of each
  task and its assignment to a worker, in order to maximize the accumulated reward
  within the budget. To address this problem, we propose the Online Worker Assignment
  (OWA) Algorithm. It optimally solves an optimization problem to balance resource
  allocation across workers and maintains virtual resource utilization according to
  the joint evolution of different workers. The competitive ratio of OWA is lower
  bounded by the closed-form expression $\max${${1}/{L},c$}$\cdot(1-K^{-\frac{1}{2}})$,
  where $L$ is the number of workers, $K$ is the resource budget, and $c$ is a constant
  derived from the problem instance. We perform trace-driven experiments with real-time
  video analytics, demonstrating the excellent capability of OWA to accommodate multiple
  workers in GMPMW.
