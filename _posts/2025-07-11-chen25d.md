title: Tuning-Free Coreset Markov Chain Monte Carlo via Hot DoG
abstract: A Bayesian coreset is a small, weighted subset of a data set that replaces
  the full data during inference to reduce computational cost. The state-of-the-art
  coreset construction algorithm, Coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo (Coreset MCMC),
  uses draws from an adaptive Markov chain targeting the coreset posterior to train
  the coreset weights via stochastic gradient optimization. However, the quality of
  the constructed coreset, and thus the quality of its posterior approximation, is
  sensitive to the stochastic optimization learning rate. In this work, we propose
  a learning-rate-free stochastic gradient optimization procedure, Hot-start Distance
  over Gradient (Hot DoG), for training coreset weights in Coreset MCMC without user
  tuning effort. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of the coreset
  weights produced by Hot DoG. We also provide empirical results demonstrate that
  Hot DoG provides higher quality posterior approximations than other learning-rate-free
  stochastic gradient methods, and performs competitively to optimally-tuned ADAM.
