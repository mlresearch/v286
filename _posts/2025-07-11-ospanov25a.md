title: Do Vendi Scores Converge with Finite Samples? Truncated Vendi Score for Finite-Sample
  Convergence Guarantees
abstract: Evaluating the diversity of generative models without reference data poses
  methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi and RKE scores address this
  by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures.
  Among these two, the Vendi score is typically computed via the eigendecomposition
  of an $n \times n$ kernel matrix constructed from n generated samples. However,
  the prohibitive computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits
  the number of samples used to fewer than 20,000. In this paper, we investigate the
  statistical convergence of the Vendi and RKE scores under restricted sample sizes.
  We numerically demonstrate that, in general, the Vendi score computed with standard
  sample sizes below 20,000 may not converge to its asymptotic value under infinite
  sampling. To address this, we introduce the $t$-truncated Vendi score by truncating
  the eigenspectrum of the kernel matrix, which is provably guaranteed to converge
  to its population limit with $n = \mathcal{O}(t)$ samples. We further show that
  existing Nyström and FKEA approximation methods converge to the asymptotic limit
  of the truncated Vendi score. In contrast to the Vendi score, we prove that the
  RKE score enjoys universal convergence guarantees across all kernel functions. We
  conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of Nyström
  and FKEA computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi score, and we analyze
  how the truncated Vendi and RKE scores correlate with the diversity of image and
  text data. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/truncated-vendi}.
