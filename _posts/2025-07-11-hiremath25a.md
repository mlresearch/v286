title: 'LoSAM: Local Search in Additive Noise Models with Mixed Mechanisms and General
  Noise for Global Causal Discovery'
abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is crucial when experiments
  are costly or infeasible. Additive noise models (ANMs) enable unique directed acyclic
  graph (DAG) identification, but existing sample-efficient ANM methods often rely
  on restrictive assumptions on the data generating process, limiting their applicability
  to real-world settings. We propose local search in additive noise models, LoSAM,
  a topological ordering method for learning a unique DAG in ANMs with mixed causal
  mechanisms and general noise distributions. We introduce new causal substructures
  and criteria for identifying roots and leaves, enabling efficient top-down learning.
  We prove asymptotic consistency and polynomial runtime, ensuring scalability and
  sample efficiency. We test LoSAM on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating
  state-of-the-art performance across all mixed mechanism settings.
