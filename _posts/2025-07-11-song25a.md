title: 'RDI: An adversarial robustness evaluation metric for deep neural networks
  based on model statistical features'
abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples,
  raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently, methods
  of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into attack-based
  and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not only relies on specific
  attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming, while the latter due to its
  analytical nature, is typically difficult to implement for large and complex models.
  A few studies evaluate model robustness based on the modelâ€™s decision boundary,
  but they suffer from low evaluation accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues,
  we propose a novel adversarial robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference
  Index (RDI), which is based on model statistical features. RDI draws inspiration
  from clustering evaluation by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances
  of feature vectors separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness.
  It is attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show
  that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard adversarial
  robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average computation time of
  RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD attack. Our open-source
  code is available at: https://github.com/BUPTAIOC/RDI.'
