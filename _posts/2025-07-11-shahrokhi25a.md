title: Conformal Prediction Sets for Deep Generative Models via Reduction to Conformal
  Regression
abstract: We consider the problem of generating valid and small prediction sets by
  sampling outputs (e.g., software code and natural language text) from a black-box
  deep generative model for a given input (e.g., textual prompt). The validity of
  a prediction set is determined by a user-defined binary admissibility function depending
  on the target application. For example, requiring at least one program in the set
  to pass all test cases in code generation application. To address this problem,
  we develop a simple and effective conformal inference algorithm referred to as {\em
  Generative Prediction Sets (GPS)}. Given a set of calibration examples and black-box
  access to a deep generative model, GPS can generate prediction sets with provable
  guarantees. The key insight behind GPS is to exploit the inherent structure within
  the distribution over the minimum number of samples needed to obtain an admissible
  output to develop a simple conformal regression approach over the minimum number
  of samples. Unlike prior work , the sets generated by GPS do not require iterative
  sampling at test time, while maintaining strict marginal coverage guarantees. Experiments
  on multiple datasets for code and math word problems using different large language
  models demonstrate the efficacy of GPS over state-of-the-art methods.
