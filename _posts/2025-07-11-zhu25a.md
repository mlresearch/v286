title: 'MSP-SR: Multi-Stage Probabilistic Generative Super Resolution with Scarce
  High-Resolution Data'
abstract: Several application domains, especially in science and medicine, benefit
  tremendously from acquiring high-resolution images of objects and phenomena of interest.
  Recognizing this need, generative models for super-resolution (SR) have emerged
  as a promising approach for such data generation. However, when training data are
  scarce due to high acquisition costs, such models struggle and often fail to capture
  the true data distribution due to insufficient data and domain knowledge. While
  transfer learning, domain adaptation, or few shot learning of such generative models
  can be a reasonable approach, most existing large scale generative models have been
  (pre)trained on natural images and it is unclear if such models can be seamlessly
  transferred to say medical images. In this paper, we propose Multi-Stage Probabilistic
  Super Resolution (MSP-SR), a cascaded few-shot learning framework for super-resolution
  through multi-stage transfer learning. At a high level, MSP-SR first transfers a
  generative model from out-of-domain to in-domain, e.g., from natural to medical
  images, and then from in-domain to the target application. We present the details
  based on conditional diffusion models and validate MSP-SR on multiple Magnetic Resonance
  Imaging (MRI) datasets, demonstrating that MSP-SR persistently and usually significantly
  outperforms direct fine-tuning (DFT) approaches as well as SR baselines. Further,
  MSP-SR empirically provides more accurate characterization of uncertainty in SR
  compared to DFT.
