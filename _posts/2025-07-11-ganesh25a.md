title: Order-Optimal Global Convergence for Actor-Critic with General Policy and Neural
  Critic Parametrization
abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving order-optimal sample complexity
  in reinforcement learning for discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with general
  policy parameterization and multi-layer neural network critics. Existing approaches
  either fail to achieve the optimal rate or assume a linear critic. We introduce
  Natural Actor-Critic with Data Drop (NAC-DD) algorithm, which integrates Natural
  Policy Gradient methods with a Data Drop technique to mitigate statistical dependencies
  inherent in Markovian sampling. NAC-DD achieves an optimal sample complexity of
  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$, marking a significant improvement over the
  previous state-of-the-art guarantee of $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$. The algorithm
  employs a multi-layer neural network critic with differentiable activation functions,
  aligning with real-world applications where tabular policies and linear critics
  are insufficient. Our work represents the first to achieve order-optimal sample
  complexity for actor-critic methods with neural function approximation, continuous
  state and action spaces, and Markovian sampling. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
  tasks confirm the theoretical findings, demonstrating the practical efficacy of
  the proposed method.
