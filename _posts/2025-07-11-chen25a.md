title: Improving Graph Contrastive Learning with Community Structure
abstract: 'Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
  training graph neural networks (GNNs) by distinguishing positive and negative node
  pairs without human labeling. However, existing GCL methods often suffer from two
  limitations: the repetitive message-passing mechanism in GNNs and the quadratic
  computational complexity of exhaustive node pair sampling in loss function. To address
  these issues, we propose an efficient and effective GCL framework that leverages
  community structure rather than relying on the intricate node-to-node adjacency
  information. Inspired by the concept of sparse low-rank approximation of graph diffusion
  matrices, our model delivers node messages to the corresponding communities instead
  of individual neighbors. By exploiting community structures, our method significantly
  improves GCL efficiency by reducing the number of node pairs needed for contrastive
  loss calculation. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that our model effectively
  captures essential structure information for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
  conducted on real-world datasets illustrate that our method not only achieves the
  state-of-the-art performance but also substantially reduces time and memory consumption
  compared with other GCL methods. Our code is available at [https://github.com/chenx-hi/IGCL-CS](https://github.com/chenx-hi/IGCL-CS).'
