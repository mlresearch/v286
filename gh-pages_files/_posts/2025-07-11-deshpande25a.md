title: Calibrated Regression Against An Adversary Without Regret
abstract: 'We are interested in probabilistic prediction in online settings in which
  data does not follow a probability distribution. Our work seeks to achieve two goals:
  (1) producing valid probabilities that accurately reflect model confidence; (2)
  ensuring that traditional notions of performance (e.g., high accuracy) still hold.
  We introduce online algorithms guaranteed to achieve these goals on arbitrary streams
  of data-points, including data chosen by an adversary. Specifically, our algorithms
  produce forecasts that are (1) calibrated i.e., an 80% confidence interval contains
  the true outcome 80% of the time-and (2) have low regret relative to a user-specified
  baseline model. We implement a post-hoc recalibration strategy that provably achieves
  these goals in regression; previous algorithms applied to classification or achieved
  (1) but not (2). In the context of Bayesian optimization, an online model-based
  decision-making task in which the data distribution shifts over time, our method
  yields accelerated convergence to improved optima.'
