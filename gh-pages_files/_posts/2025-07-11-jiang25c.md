title: Best Possible Q-Learning
abstract: Fully decentralized learning, where the global information, *i.e.*, the
  actions of other agents, is inaccessible, is a fundamental challenge in cooperative
  multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, the convergence and optimality of most
  decentralized algorithms are not theoretically guaranteed, since the transition
  probabilities are non-stationary as all agents are updating policies simultaneously.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose \textit{best possible operator}, a novel decentralized
  operator, and prove that the policies of cooperative agents will converge to the
  optimal joint policy if each agent independently updates its individual state-action
  value by the operator when there is only one optimal joint policy. Further, to make
  the update more efficient and practical, we simplify the operator and prove that
  the convergence and optimality still hold with the simplified one. By instantiating
  the simplified operator, the derived fully decentralized algorithm, *best possible
  Q-learning* (BQL), does not suffer from non-stationarity. Empirically, we show that
  BQL achieves remarkable improvement over baselines in a variety of cooperative multi-agent
  tasks.
