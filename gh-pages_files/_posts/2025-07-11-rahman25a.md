title: 'FeDCM: Federated Learning of Deep Causal Generative Models'
abstract: In many real-world settings, such as medicine and finance causal effect
  is a valuable metric for decision making. For many predictive tasks, causal mechanisms
  provide robust estimators while existing ML-driven predictors might be vulnerable
  to spurious correlations. In such settings, when data is decentralized and privacy
  must be preserved, federated learning plays an important role. However, causal inference
  in a federated learning setup is a largely unexplored research area. In this paper,
  we learn a proxy of the underlying structural causal model (SCM) with deep generative
  models from decentralized observational data sources possibly containing high-dimensional
  variables. Based on client preference or high dimensionality of variables, we modularize
  the SCM mechanisms and find the minimal subset appropriate for federated learning
  while having rest of the mechanisms trained on individual clientâ€™s local data. When
  all connected together, the proxy SCM, named as the federated deep causal generative
  model (FeDCM ), offers estimation of any identifiable causal effect. We perform
  extensive experiments to illustrate the utility and performance of our approach.
