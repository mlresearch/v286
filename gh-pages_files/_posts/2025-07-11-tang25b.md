title: 'InfoDPCCA: Information-Theoretic Dynamic Probabilistic Canonical Correlation
  Analysis'
abstract: Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential
  data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning natural
  science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic probabilistic Canonical
  Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model two interdependent sequences
  of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel information-theoretic objective to
  extract a shared latent representation that captures the mutual structure between
  the data streams and balances representation compression and predictive sufficiency
  while also learning separate latent components that encode information specific
  to each sequence. Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly
  enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between the
  sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce a two-step
  training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic representation learning
  and generative modeling, along with a residual connection mechanism to enhance training
  stability. Through experiments on synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate
  that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is
  available at https://github.com/marcusstang/InfoDPCCA.
