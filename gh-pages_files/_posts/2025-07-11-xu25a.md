title: Variational Learning of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models through Stochastic
  Gradient Annealed Importance Sampling
abstract: Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly
  popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data
  recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted
  version of the Bayesian GPLVMs has been proposed to obtain a tighter variational
  bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple
  data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become
  quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this
  work, we propose VAIS-GPLVM, a variational Annealed Importance Sampling method that
  leverages time-inhomogeneous unadjusted Langevin dynamics to construct the variational
  posterior. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions
  using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and
  VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the
  target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing
  all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy
  and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  in terms of tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust
  convergence.
