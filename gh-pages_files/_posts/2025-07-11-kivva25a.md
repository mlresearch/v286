title: Causal Effect Identification in Heterogeneous Environments from Higher-Order
  Moments
abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable
  on an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the causal
  effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available from multiple
  environments, provided that the target causal effect remains invariant across these
  environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based algorithm for estimating the causal
  effect as long as only a single parameter of the data-generating mechanism varies
  across environments â€“ whether it be the exogenous noise distribution or the causal
  relationship between two variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is
  lost if both exogenous noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables
  vary across environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter
  of the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
  the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.
