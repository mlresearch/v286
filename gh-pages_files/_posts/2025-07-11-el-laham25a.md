title: 'Mixup Regularization: A Probabilistic Perspective'
abstract: In recent years, mixup regularization has gained popularity as an effective
  way to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by training
  on convex combinations of training data. While many mixup variants have been explored,
  the proper adoption of the technique to conditional density estimation and probabilistic
  machine learning remains relatively unexplored. This work introduces a novel framework
  for mixup regularization based on probabilistic fusion that is better suited for
  conditional density estimation tasks. For data distributed according to a member
  of the exponential family, we show that likelihood functions can be analytically
  fused using log-linear pooling. We further propose an extension of probabilistic
  mixup, which allows for fusion of inputs at an arbitrary intermediate layer of the
  neural network. We provide a theoretical analysis comparing our approach to standard
  mixup variants. Empirical results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
  benefits of our proposed framework compared to existing mixup variants.
