title: Transparent Trade-offs between Properties of Explanations
abstract: When explaining machine learning models, it is important for explanations
  to have certain properties like faithfulness, robustness, smoothness, low complexity,
  etc. However, many properties are in tension with each other, making it challenging
  to achieve them simultaneously. For example, reducing the complexity of an explanation
  can make it less expressive, compromising its faithfulness. The ideal balance of
  trade-offs between properties tends to vary across different tasks and users. Motivated
  by these varying needs, we aim to find explanations that make optimal trade-offs
  while allowing for transparent control over the balance between different properties.
  Unlike existing methods that encourage desirable properties implicitly through their
  design, our approach optimizes explanations explicitly for a linear mixture of multiple
  properties. By adjusting the mixture weights, users can control the balance between
  those properties and create explanations with precisely what is needed for their
  particular task.
