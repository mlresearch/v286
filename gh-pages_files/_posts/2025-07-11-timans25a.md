title: On Continuous Monitoring of Risk Violations under Unknown Shift
abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in the real world must operate under dynamic
  and often unpredictable distribution shifts. This challenges the validity of statistical
  safety assurances on the system’s risk established beforehand. Common risk control
  frameworks rely on fixed assumptions and lack mechanisms to continuously monitor
  deployment reliability. In this work, we propose a general framework for the real-time
  monitoring of risk violations in evolving data streams. Leveraging the ‘testing
  by betting’ paradigm, we propose a sequential hypothesis testing procedure to detect
  violations of bounded risks associated with the model’s decision-making mechanism,
  while ensuring control on the false alarm rate. Our method operates under minimal
  assumptions on the nature of encountered shifts, rendering it broadly applicable.
  We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by monitoring risks in outlier detection
  and set prediction under a variety of shifts.
