title: 'SPvR: Structured Pruning via Ranking'
abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple
  domains but are increasingly resource-intensive, limiting their deployment on constrained
  devices. We introduce Structured Pruning via Ranking (SPvR), a novel structured
  pruning approach to address this challenge for classification tasks. SPvR prunes
  pre-trained networks in terms of function composition and network width while adhering
  to a user-specified parameter budget. Our method leverages local grouping and global
  ranking modules to generate smaller yet effective networks tailored to a given dataset
  and model. Finally, we train the pruned networks from scratch, instead of fine-tuning.
  Our evaluations demonstrate that SPvR significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
  pruning methods on benchmark datasets, using standard architectures. Even with a
  $90$% reduction in size, SPvRâ€™s sub-networks experience a minimal drop in test accuracy
  $(<1$%$)$ while on ImageNet1K, we outperform all baselines by achieving $<1$% Top-5
  accuracy drop when pruning $70$% of ResNet50 parameters. Additionally, when compared
  to MobileNetV3, an SPvR pruned network improves the Top-1 accuracy by $3.3$% with
  $20$% less parameters. Furthermore, we empirically show that SPvR achieves reduced
  inference latency, underscoring its practical benefits for deploying neural networks
  on resource-constrained devices.
