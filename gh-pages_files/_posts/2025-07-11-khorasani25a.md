title: Efficiently Escaping Saddle Points for Policy Optimization
abstract: Policy gradient (PG) is widely used in reinforcement learning due to its
  scalability and good performance. In recent years, several variance-reduced PG methods
  have been proposed with a theoretical guarantee of converging to an approximate
  first-order stationary point (FOSP) with the sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$.
  However, FOSPs could be bad local optima or saddle points. Moreover, these algorithms
  often use importance sampling (IS) weights which could impair the statistical effectiveness
  of variance reduction. In this paper, we propose a variance-reduced second-order
  method that uses second-order information in the form of Hessian vector products
  (HVP) and converges to an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) with
  sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. This rate improves the best-known
  sample complexity for achieving approximate SOSPs by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-0.5})$.
  Moreover, the proposed variance reduction technique bypasses IS weights by using
  HVP terms. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
  the state of the art and is more robust to changes in random seeds.
