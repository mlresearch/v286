title: Flat Posterior Does Matter For Bayesian Model Averaging
abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) estimate the posterior distribution of model
  parameters and utilize posterior samples for Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in prediction.
  However, despite the crucial role of flatness in the loss landscape in improving
  the generalization of neural networks, its impact on BMA has been largely overlooked.
  In this work, we explore how posterior flatness influences BMA generalization and
  empirically demonstrate that \emph{(1) most approximate Bayesian inference methods
  fail to yield a flat posterior} and \emph{(2) BMA predictions, without considering
  posterior flatness, are less effective at improving generalization}. To address
  this, we propose Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Model Averaging (FP-BMA), a novel
  training objective that explicitly encourages flat posteriors in a principled Bayesian
  manner. We also introduce a Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Transfer Learning scheme
  that enhances generalization in downstream tasks. Empirically, we show that FP-BMA
  successfully captures flat posteriors, improving generalization performance.
