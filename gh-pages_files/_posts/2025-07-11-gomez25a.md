title: 'Over the Top-1: Uncertainty-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval with CLIP'
abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models, such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
  performance in cross-modal retrieval tasks, yet estimating their predictive uncertainty
  remains an open challenge. While recent works have explored probabilistic embeddings
  to quantify retrieval uncertainty, these approaches often require model retraining
  or fine-tuning adapters, making them computationally expensive and dataset-dependent.
  In this work, we propose a training-free framework for uncertainty estimation in
  cross-modal retrieval. We start with a simple yet effective baseline that uses the
  cosine similarity between a query and its top-ranked match as an uncertainty measure.
  Building on this, we introduce a method that estimates uncertainty by analyzing
  the consistency of the top-1 retrieved item across samples drawn from the posterior
  predictive distribution using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) or Deep Ensembles. Finally,
  we propose an adversarial perturbation-based method, where the minimal perturbation
  required to alter the top-1 retrieval serves as a robust indicator of uncertainty.
  Empirical results in two standard cross-modal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that
  our approach achieves superior calibration compared to learned probabilistic methods,
  all while incurring zero additional training cost.
