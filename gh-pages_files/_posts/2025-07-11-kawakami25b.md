title: Decomposition of Probabilities of Causation with Two Mediators
abstract: Mediation analysis for probabilities of causation (PoC) provides a fundamental
  framework for evaluating the necessity and sufficiency of treatment in provoking
  an event through different causal pathways. One of the primary objectives of causal
  mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into path-specific components.
  In this study, we investigate the path-specific probability of necessity and sufficiency
  (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into path-specific components along distinct causal
  pathways between treatment and outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the
  path-specific PNS for decomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore,
  we conduct numerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators
  from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world
  educational dataset.
