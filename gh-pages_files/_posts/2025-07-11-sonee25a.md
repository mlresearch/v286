title: Privacy-Preserving Neural Processes for Probabilistic User Modeling
abstract: Uncertainty-aware user modeling is crucial for designing AI systems that
  adapt to users in real-time while addressing privacy concerns. This paper proposes
  a novel framework for privacy-preserving probabilistic user modeling that integrates
  uncertainty quantification and differential privacy (DP). Building on neural processes
  (NPs), a scalable latent variable probabilistic model, we enable meta-learning for
  user behaviour prediction under privacy constraints. By employing differentially
  private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), our method achieves rigorous privacy
  guarantees while preserving predictive accuracy. Unlike prior work, which primarily
  addresses privacy-preserving learning for convex or smooth functions, we establish
  theoretical guarantees for non-convex objectives, focusing on the utility-privacy
  trade-offs inherent in uncertainty-aware models. Through extensive experiments,
  we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy under stringent privacy
  budgets. Our results showcase the potential of privacy-preserving probabilistic
  user models to enable trustworthy AI systems in real-world interactive applications.
