title: Truthful Elicitation of Imprecise Forecasts
abstract: The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under
  uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise
  forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their
  beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs)
  prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework
  for scoring \emph{imprecise forecasts}—forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite
  existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful
  elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way
  communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging
  or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This,
  in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show
  that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring
  rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit
  and integrate the forecaster’s epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making
  process, improving the credibility of downstream decisions.
