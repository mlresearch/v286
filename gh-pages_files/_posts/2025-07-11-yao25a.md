title: "$σ$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs"
abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of Directed
  Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These graphical objects
  encode information about ancestral relations and d-separations of the DAGs they
  represent. This abstract representation has been used amongst others to prove the
  soundness and completeness of the FCI algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive
  a do-calculus for its output. One significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that
  they rule out the possibility of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address
  that limitation. We introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin
  "$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs" ("$\sigma$-MAGs"). We show how these graphs
  provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs (DGs) with
  latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent DAGs. We study the
  properties of these objects and provide a characterization of their Markov equivalence
  classes.
