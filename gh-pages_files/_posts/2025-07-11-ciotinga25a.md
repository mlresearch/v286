title: Optimal Transport for Probabilistic Circuits
abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits
  (PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions represented
  as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of our knowledge,
  there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability
  distributions given by PCs. We propose a Wasserstein-type distance that restricts
  the coupling measure of the associated optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic
  circuit. We then develop an algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series
  of small linear programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable.
  Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan between
  the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study the empirical
  Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we can estimate the
  PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient iterative algorithm.
