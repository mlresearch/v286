title: On Constant Regret for Low-Rank MDPs
abstract: Although there exist instance-dependent regret bounds for linear Markov
  decision processes (MDPs) and low-rank bandits, extensions to low-rank MDPs remain
  unexplored. In this work, we close this gap and provide regret bounds for low-rank
  MDPs in an instance-dependent setting. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm,
  called UniSREP-UCB, which utilizes a constrained optimization objective to learn
  features with good spectral properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm
  enjoys constant regret if the minimal sub-optimality gap and the occupancy distribution
  of the optimal policy are well-defined and known. To the best of our knowledge,
  these are the first instance-dependent regret results for low-rank MDPs.
