title: Label Distribution Learning using the Squared Neural Family on the Probability
  Simplex
abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) provides a framework wherein a distribution
  over categories rather than a single category is predicted, with the aim of addressing
  ambiguity in labeled data. Existing research on LDL mainly focuses on the task of
  point estimation, i.e., finding an optimal distribution in the probability simplex
  conditioned on the given sample. In this paper, we propose a novel label distribution
  learning model SNEFY-LDL, which estimates a probability distribution of all possible
  label distributions over the simplex, by unleashing the expressive power of the
  recently introduced Squared Neural Family (SNEFY), a new class of tractable probability
  models. As a way to summarize the fitted model, we derive the closed-form label
  distribution mean, variance and covariance conditioned on the given sample, which
  can be used to predict the ground-truth label distributions, construct label distribution
  confidence intervals, and measure the correlations between different labels. Moreover,
  more information about the label distribution prediction uncertainties can be acquired
  from the modeled probability density function. Extensive experiments on conformal
  prediction, active learning and ensemble learning are conducted, verifying SNEFY-LDLâ€™s
  great effectiveness in LDL uncertainty quantification. The source code of this paper
