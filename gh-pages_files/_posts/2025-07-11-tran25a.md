title: Optimal Transport Alignment of User Preferences from Ratings and Texts
abstract: 'Modeling hidden factors driving user preferences is crucial for recommendation
  yet challenging due to sparse rating data. While aligning preference factors from
  ratings and texts, as a solution, shows improvements, existing methods impose restrictive
  one-to-one factor correspondences and underutilize cross-modal interest signals.
  We propose an optimal transport (OT) approach to address these gaps. By modeling
  rating- and text-based preference factors as distributions, we compute an OT plan
  that captures their probabilistic relationships. This plan serves dual roles: 1)
  to regularize cross-modal preference factors without rigid correspondence assumptions,
  and 2) to blend preference signals across modalities through barycentric mapping.
  Experiments on real-world datasets validate our methodâ€™s effectiveness over competitive
  baselines, highlighting its novel use of OT for adaptive preference factor alignment,
  an underexplored direction in recommender system research.'
