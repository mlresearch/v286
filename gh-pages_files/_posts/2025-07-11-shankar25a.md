title: Experimentation under Treatment Dependent Network Interference
abstract: 'Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are a fundamental aspect of data-driven
  decision-making. RCTs often assume that the units are not influenced by each other.
  Traditional approaches addressing such effects assume a fixed network structure
  between the interfering units. However, real-world networks are rarely static, and
  treatment assignments can actively reshape the interference structure itself, as
  seen in financial access interventions that alter informal lending networks or healthcare
  programs that modify peer influence dynamics. This creates a novel and unexplored
  problem: estimating treatment effects when the interference network is determined
  by treatment allocation. In this work, we address this gap by proposing two single-experiment
  estimators for scenarios where network edges depend on nodal treatments constructed
  from instrumental variables derived from neighbourhood treatments. We prove their
  unbiasedness and experimentally validate the proposed estimators both on synthetic
  and real data.'
