title: Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation Under Hidden Confounders
abstract: One of the major challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes
  and conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is the presence of hidden confounders.
  Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only with observational
  data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in the literature of CATE
  estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE estimation can be significantly
  biased due to the effects of unobserved confounders. In this work, we consider the
  case where in addition to a potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset
  from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions
  on the existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require
  the outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a pseudo-confounder
  generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential outcomes from the observational
  data with those observed from the RCT. Our method is applicable to many practical
  scenarios of interest, particularly those where privacy is a concern (e.g., medical
  applications). Extensive numerical experiments are provided demonstrating the effectiveness
  of our approach for both synthetic and real-world datasets.
