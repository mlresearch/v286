title: 'FedSPD: A Soft-clustering Approach for Personalized Decentralized Federated
  Learning'
abstract: Federated learning has recently gained popularity as a framework for distributed
  clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model using local data. While
  traditional federated learning relies on a central server for model aggregation,
  recent advancements adopt a decentralized framework, enabling direct model exchange
  between clients and eliminating the single point of failure. However, existing decentralized
  frameworks often assume all clients train a shared model. Personalizing each clientâ€™s
  model can enhance performance, especially with heterogeneous client data distributions.
  We propose FedSPD, an efficient personalized federated learning algorithm for the
  decentralized setting, and show that it learns accurate models in low-connectivity
  networks. To provide theoretical guarantees on convergence, we introduce a clustering-based
  framework that enables consensus on models for distinct data clusters while personalizing
  to unique mixtures of these clusters at different clients. This flexibility, allowing
  selective model updates based on data distribution, substantially reduces communication
  costs compared to prior work on personalized federated learning in decentralized
  settings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that FedSPD outperforms
  multiple decentralized variants of existing personalized federated learning algorithms
  in scenarios with low-connectivity networks.
