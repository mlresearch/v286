title: Unsupervised Attributed Dynamic Network Embedding with Stability Guarantees
abstract: Stability for dynamic network embeddings ensures that nodes behaving the
  same at different times receive the same embedding, allowing comparison of nodes
  in the network across time. We present attributed unfolded adjacency spectral embedding
  (AUASE), a stable unsupervised representation learning framework for dynamic networks
  in which nodes are attributed with time-varying covariate information. To establish
  stability, we prove uniform convergence to an associated latent position model.
  We quantify the benefits of our dynamic embedding by comparing with state-of-the-art
  network representation learning methods on three real attributed networks. To the
  best of our knowledge, AUASE is the only attributed dynamic embedding that satisfies
  stability guarantees without the need for ground truth labels, which we demonstrate
  provides significant improvements for link prediction and node classification.
