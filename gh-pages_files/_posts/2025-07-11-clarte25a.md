title: Building Conformal Prediction Intervals with Approximate Message Passing
abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful tool for building prediction
  intervals that are valid in a distribution-free way. However, its evaluation may
  be computationally costly, especially in the high-dimensional setting where the
  dimensionality and sample sizes are both large and of comparable magnitudes. To
  address this challenge in the context of generalized linear regression, we propose
  a novel algorithm based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP) to accelerate the computation
  of prediction intervals using full conformal prediction, by approximating the computation
  of conformity scores. Our work bridges a gap between modern uncertainty quantification
  techniques and tools for high-dimensional problems involving the AMP algorithm.
  We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real data, and show that it produces
  prediction intervals that are close to the baseline methods, while being orders
  of magnitude faster. Additionally, in the high-dimensional limit and under assumptions
  on the data distribution, the conformity scores computed by AMP converge to the
  one computed exactly, which allows theoretical study and benchmarking of conformal
  methods in high dimensions.
