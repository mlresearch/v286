title: 'ELF: Federated Langevin Algorithms with Primal, Dual and Bidirectional Compression'
abstract: Federated sampling algorithms have recently gained great popularity in the
  community of machine learning and statistics. This paper proposes a new federated
  sampling algorithm called Error Feedback Langevin algorithms (ELF). In particular,
  we analyze the combinations of EF21 and EF21-P with the federated Langevin Monte-Carlo.
  We propose three algorithms, P-ELF, D-ELF, and B-ELF, that use primal, dual, and
  bidirectional compressors. We analyze the proposed methods under Log-Sobolev inequality
  and provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Simple experimental results support
  our theoretical findings.
