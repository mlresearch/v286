title: CATE Estimation With Potential Outcome Imputation From Local Regression
abstract: One of the most significant challenges in Conditional Average Treatment
  Effect (CATE) estimation is the statistical discrepancy between distinct treatment
  groups. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic data augmentation method
  for CATE estimation. First, we derive regret bounds for general data augmentation
  methods suggesting that a small imputation error may be necessary for accurate CATE
  estimation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a contrastive learning approach that
  reliably imputes missing potential outcomes for a selected subset of individuals
  formed using a similarity measure. We augment the original dataset with these reliable
  imputations to reduce the discrepancy between different treatment groups while inducing
  minimal imputation error. The augmented dataset can subsequently be employed to
  train standard CATE estimation models. We provide both theoretical guarantees and
  extensive numerical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving
  the accuracy and robustness of numerous CATE estimation models.
