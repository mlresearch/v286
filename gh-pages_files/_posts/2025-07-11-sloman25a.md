title: Proxy-informed Bayesian transfer learning with unknown sources
abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one’s training data requires leveraging
  prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don’t, between
  different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying and refining
  this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target (prediction) data. A challenging
  open problem is addressing the empirical phenomenon of negative transfer, whereby
  the transfer learner performs worse on the target data after taking the source data
  into account than before. We first introduce a Bayesian perspective on negative
  transfer, and then a method to address it. The key insight from our formulation
  is that negative transfer can stem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable
  causes of the source data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for
  probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of the
  source data (the data sources may be "unknown"). PROMPT is thus applicable when
  differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of latent confounders.
  Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations in the target task (may
  not have the ability to "fine-tune"), and instead makes use of proxy (indirect)
  information. Our theoretical results show that the threat of negative transfer does
  not depend on the informativeness of the proxy information, highlighting the usefulness
  of PROMPT in cases where only noisy indirect information, such as human feedback,
  is available.
