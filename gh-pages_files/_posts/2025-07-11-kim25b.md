title: 'Bayesian Optimization with Inexact Acquisition: Is Random Grid Search Sufficient?'
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for optimizing
  black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an acquisition function,
  such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path from the Gaussian process
  (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS). However, finding an exact solution
  to these maximization problems is often intractable and computationally expensive.
  Reflecting such realistic situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of
  inexact maximizers of the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy
  in acquisition solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB
  and GP-TS without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization.
  Our results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy, inexact
  BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated from such
  findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical validation for
  random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient acquisition function
  solver.
