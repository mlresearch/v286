title: Explaining Negative Classifications of AI Models in Tumor Diagnosis
abstract: Using AI models in healthcare is gaining popularity. To improve clinician
  confidence in the results of automated triage and to provide further information
  about the suggested diagnosis, an explanation produced by a separate post-hoc explainability
  tool often accompanies the classification of an AI model. If no abnormalities are
  detected, however, it is not clear what an explanation should be. A human clinician
  might be able to describe certain salient features of tumors that are not in scan,
  but existing Explainable AI tools cannot do that, as they cannot point to features
  that are absent from the input. In this paper, we present a definition of and algorithm
  for providing explanations of absence; that is, explanations of negative classifications
  in the context of healthcare AI. Our approach is rooted in the concept of explanations
  in actual causality. It uses the model as a black-box and is hence portable and
  works with proprietary models. Moreover, the computation is done in the preprocessing
  stage, based on the model and the dataset. During the execution, the algorithm only
  projects the precomputed explanation template on the current image. We implemented
  this approach in a tool, nito, and trialed it on a number of medical datasets to
  demonstrate its utility on the classification of solid tumors. We discuss the differences
  between the theoretical approach and the implementation in the domain of classifying
  solid tumors and address the additional complications posed by this domain. Finally,
  we discuss the assumptions we make in our algorithm and its possible extensions
  to explanations of absence for general image classifiers.
