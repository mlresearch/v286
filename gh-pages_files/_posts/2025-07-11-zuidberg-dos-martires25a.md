title: A Quantum Information Theoretic Approach to Tractable Probabilistic Models
abstract: By recursively nesting sums and products, probabilistic circuits have emerged
  in recent years as an attractive class of generative models as they enjoy, for instance,
  polytime marginalization of random variables. In this work we study these machine
  learning models using the framework of quantum information theory, leading to the
  introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which generalize circuit evaluations
  over positive real-valued probabilities to circuit evaluations over positive semi-definite
  matrices. As a consequence, PUnCs strictly generalize probabilistic circuits as
  well as recently introduced circuit classes such as PSD circuits.
