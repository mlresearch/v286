title: The Causal Information Bottleneck and Optimal Causal Variable Abstractions
abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct
  abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving
  key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to
  construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining
  predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely
  statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for
  causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension
  of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control
  over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables
  which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between
  the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning
  about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned
  abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.
