title: Robust Optimization with Diffusion Models for Green Security
abstract: In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior-such as
  poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing-to plan effective patrols. These
  behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory
  to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial
  behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack
  the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this
  limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling,
  leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain.
  Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents
  new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample
  from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges,
  we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential
  Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is
  guaranteed to converge to an \(\epsilon\)-equilibrium with high probability using
  a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach
  on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.
