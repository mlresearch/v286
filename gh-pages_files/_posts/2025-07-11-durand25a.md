title: Learning Causal Response Representations through Direct Effect Analysis
abstract: We propose a novel approach for learning causal response representations.
  Our method aims to extract directions in which a multidimensional outcome is most
  directly caused by a treatment variable. By bridging conditional independence testing
  with causal representation learning, we formulate an optimisation problem that maximises
  the evidence against conditional independence between the treatment and outcome,
  given a conditioning set. This formulation employs flexible regression models tailored
  to specific applications, creating a versatile framework. The problem is addressed
  through a generalised eigenvalue decomposition. We show that, under mild assumptions,
  the distribution of the largest eigenvalue can be bounded by a known $F$-distribution,
  enabling testable conditional independence. We also provide theoretical guarantees
  for the optimality of the learned representation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio
  and Fisher information maximisation. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness
  of our approach in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results underscore
  the utility of this framework in uncovering direct causal effects within complex,
  multivariate settings.
