title: Near-Optimal Regret Bounds for Federated Multi-armed Bandits with Fully Distributed
  Communication
abstract: In this paper, we focus on the research of federated multi-armed bandit
  (FMAB) problems where agents can only communicate with their neighbors. All agents
  aim to solve a common multi-armed banditÂ (MAB) problem to minimize individual regrets,
  while group regret can also be minimized. In a federated bandit problem, an agent
  fails to estimate the global reward means of arms by only using local observations,
  and hence, the bandit learning algorithm usually adopts a consensus estimation strategy
  to address the heterogeneity. However, up to now, the existing algorithms with fully
  distributed communication graphs only achieved a suboptimal result for the problem.
  To address that, a fully distributed online consensus estimation algorithm (\texttt{CES})
  is proposed to estimate the global mean without bias. Integrating this consensus
  estimator into a distributed successive elimination bandit algorithm framework yields
  our federated bandit algorithm. Our algorithm significantly improves both individual
  and group regrets over previous approaches, and we provide an in-depth analysis
  of the lower bound for this problem.
