title: Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent Algorithm for Multi-Objective Distributional
  Optimization
abstract: We address the optimization problem of simultaneously minimizing multiple
  objective functionals over a family of probability distributions. This type of Multi-Objective
  Distributional Optimization commonly arises in machine learning and statistics,
  with applications in areas such as multiple target sampling, multi-task learning,
  and multi-objective generative modeling. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative
  particle-based algorithm, which we call Muliple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD),
  which constructs a flow of intermediate empirical distributions, each being represented
  by a set of particles, which gradually minimize the multiple objective functionals
  simultaneously. Specifically, MWGraD consists of two key steps at each iteration.
  First, it estimates the Wasserstein gradient for each objective functional based
  on the current particles. Then, it aggregates these gradients into a single Wasserstein
  gradient using dynamically adjusted weights and updates the particles accordingly.
  In addition, we provide theoretical analysis and present experimental results on
  both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MWGraD.
