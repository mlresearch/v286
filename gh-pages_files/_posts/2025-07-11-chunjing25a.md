title: Learning Multi-interest Embedding with Dynamic Graph Cluster for Sequention
  Recommendation
abstract: Multi-interest recommendation is to predict the next item by representing
  diversity of a user preference with multiple interest embeddings. Although existing
  methods have achieved convincing results in recommendation tasks, they ignore the
  continuously changing relations of no-adjacent items in a sequence. In this paper,
  we focus on how to fully capture the changing relations when capturing the user
  multi-interest representations. Specifically, we propose a novel dynamic graph cluster-based
  multi-interest model named MDGR, which not only comprehensively explores the real
  changing item relations between no-adjacent items by iteratively constructing and
  continuously optimizing interest sub-graph to update the multiple interest embeddings
  but also collaborates temporal information and interest weight to model the interactive
  behaviors of users and items.Our model iteratively constructs and continuously optimizes
  the interest sub-graph by comprehensively adopting dynamic graph cluster to explore
  the item relations in sequences. That is beneficial to dynamically model user multiple
  interests. Furthermore, we employ the attention module to extract different influence
  of various interest embeddings. Finally, we use the refined item embedding and the
  final multi-interest embeddings to retrieval the next item that a user is most likely
  to interact with. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore
  multi-interest embeddings by iteratively constructing and continuously optimizing
  the interest sub-graph. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets
  demonstrate that MDGR outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
