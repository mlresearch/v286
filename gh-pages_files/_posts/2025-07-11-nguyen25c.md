title: Bayesian Optimization over Bounded Domains with the Beta Product Kernel
abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to optimize
  black-box functions. The Matérn and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) covariance functions
  are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions about the domain of the
  function, which may limit their applicability in bounded domains. To address the
  limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a non-stationary kernel induced by a product
  of Beta distribution density functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to
  naturally model functions on bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting
  the hypothesis that the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on
  empirical analyses of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental
  results demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with
  optima located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments
  show that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including
  the well-known Matérn and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic function
  optimization and the compression of vision and language models.
