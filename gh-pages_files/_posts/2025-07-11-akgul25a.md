title: Conformal Prediction for Federated Graph Neural Networks with Missing Neighbor
  Information
abstract: 'Uncertainty quantification is essential for reliable federated graph learning,
  yet existing methods struggle with decentralized and heterogeneous data. In this
  work, we first extend Conformal Prediction (CP), a well-established method for uncertainty
  quantification, to federated graph learning, formalizing conditions for CP validity
  under partial exchangeability across distributed subgraphs. We prove that our approach
  maintains rigorous coverage guarantees even with client-specific data distributions.
  Building on this foundation, we address a key challenge in federated graph learning:
  missing neighbor information, which inflates CP set sizes and reduces efficiency.
  To mitigate this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based architecture
  that reconstructs missing neighbors while preserving data privacy. Empirical evaluations
  on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method: our theoretically
  grounded federated training strategy reduces CP set sizes by 15.4%, with the VAE-based
  reconstruction providing an additional 4.9% improvement, all while maintaining rigorous
  coverage guarantees.'
