title: 'HDP-Flow: Generalizable Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Time Series State
  Discovery'
abstract: We introduce HDP-Flow, a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) model for unsupervised
  state discovery in dynamic, non-stationary time series data. Unlike prior work that
  assumes fixed states, HDPFlow models evolving datasets with unknown and variable
  latent states. By integrating the adaptability of BNP models with the expressive
  power of normalizing flows, HDP-Flow effectively models dynamic, non-stationary
  patterns, while learning transferable states across datasets with wellcalibrated
  uncertainty. We propose a scalable variational algorithm to enable efficient inference,
  addressing the limitations of traditional sampling-based BNP methods. HDP-Flow outperforms
  existing approaches in latent state identification and provides probabilistic insight
  into state distributions and transition dynamics. Evaluating HDP-Flow across two
  wearable datasets demonstrates transferability of states across diverse sub-populations,
  validating its robustness and generalizability.
