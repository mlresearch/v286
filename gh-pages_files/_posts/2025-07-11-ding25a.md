title: Nearly Optimal Differentially Private ReLU Regression
abstract: In this paper, we investigate one of the most fundamental non-convex learning
  problems-ReLU regression-in the Differential Privacy (DP) model. Previous studies
  on private ReLU regression heavily rely on stringent assumptions, such as constant-bounded
  norms for feature vectors and labels. We relax these assumptions to a more standard
  setting, where data can be i.i.d. sampled from $O(1)$-sub-Gaussian distributions.
  We first show that when $\varepsilon = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}})$ and there
  is some public data, it is possible to achieve an upper bound of $\Tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{N^2
  \varepsilon^2})$ for the excess population risk in $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, where
  $d$ is the dimension and $N$ is the number of data samples. Moreover, we relax the
  requirement of $\epsilon$ and public data by proposing and analyzing a one-pass
  mini-batch Generalized Linear Model Perceptron algorithm (DP-MBGLMtron). Additionally,
  using the tracing attack argument technique, we demonstrate that the minimax rate
  of the estimation error for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms is lower bounded
  by $\Omega(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$. This shows that DP-MBGLMtron achieves
  the optimal utility bound up to logarithmic factors. Experiments further support
  our theoretical results.
