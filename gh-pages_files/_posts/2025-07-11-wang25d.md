title: A Parallel Network for LRCT Segmentation and Uncertainty Mitigation with Fuzzy
  Sets
abstract: Accurate segmentation of airways in Low-Resolution CT (LRCT) scans is vital
  for diagnostics in scenarios such as reduced radiation exposure, emergency response,
  or limited resources. Yet manual annotation is labor-intensive and prone to variability,
  while existing automated methods often fail to capture small airway branches in
  lower-resolution 3D data. To address this, we introduce \textbf{FuzzySR}, a parallel
  framework that merges super-resolution (SR) and segmentation. By concurrently producing
  high-resolution reconstructions and precise airway masks, it enhances anatomic fidelity
  and captures delicate bronchi. FuzzySR employs a deep fuzzy set mechanism, leveraging
  learnable $t$-distribution and triangular membership functions via cross-attention.
  Through parameters $\mu$, $\sigma$, and $d_f$, it preserves uncertain features and
  mitigates boundary noise. Extensive evaluations on lung cancer, COVID-19, and pulmonary
  fibrosis datasets confirm FuzzySRâ€™s superior segmentation accuracy on LRCT, surpassing
  even high-resolution baselines. By uniting fuzzy-logic-driven uncertainty handling
  with SR-based resolution enhancement, FuzzySR effectively bridges the gap for robust
  airway delineation from LRCT data.
