title: Letting Uncertainty Guide Your Multimodal Machine Translation
abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) leverages additional modalities, such
  as visual data, to enhance translation accuracy and resolve linguistic ambiguities
  inherent in text-only approaches. Recent advancements predominantly focus on integrating
  image information via attention mechanisms or feature fusion techniques. However,
  current approaches lack explicit mechanisms to quantify and manage the uncertainty
  during translation process, resulting in the utilization of image information being
  a black box. This makes it difficult to effectively address the issues of incomplete
  utilization of visual information and even potential degradation of translation
  quality when using visual information.To address these challenges, we introduce
  a novel Uncertainty-Guided Multimodal Machine Translation (UG-MMT) framework that
  redefines how translation systems handle ambiguity through systematic uncertainty
  reduction. Designed with plug-and-play flexibility, our framework enables seamless
  integration into existing MMT systems, requiring minimal modification while delivering
  significant performance gains.
