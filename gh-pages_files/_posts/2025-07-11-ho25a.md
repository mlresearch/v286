title: Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal
  Graph Conditional Diffusion Models
abstract: 'Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic
  datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental
  conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with
  noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked.
  In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise
  within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel
  and practical TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced
  approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training
  phase. TSAD-C encompasses three modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies present
  during training and swiftly prepare the decontaminated data for subsequent modules;
  a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-range intra- and
  inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as
  a surrogate of the pure normal data; and an Anomaly Scoring module that leverages
  insights of the first two modules to detect all types of anomalies. Our extensive
  experiments conducted on four reliable, diverse, and challenging datasets conclusively
  demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methods, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art
  in the TSAD field.'
