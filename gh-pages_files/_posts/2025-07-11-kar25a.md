title: Provably Adaptive Average Reward Reinforcement Learning for Metric Spaces
abstract: We study infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) for
  Lipschitz MDPs, a broad class that subsumes several important classes such as linear
  and RKHS MDPs, function approximation frameworks, and develop an adaptive algorithm
  $\text{ZoRL}$ with regret bounded as $\mathcal{O}\big(T^{1 - d_{\text{eff.}}^{-1}}\big)$,
  where $d_{\text{eff.}}= 2d_\mathcal{S} + d_z + 3$, $d_\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension
  of the state space and $d_z$ is the zooming dimension. In contrast, algorithms with
  fixed discretization yield $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2(d_\mathcal{S} + d_\mathcal{A}) +
  2$, $d_\mathcal{A}$ being the dimension of action space. $\text{ZoRL}$ achieves
  this by discretizing the state-action space adaptively and zooming into ”promising
  regions” of the state-action space. $d_z$, a problem-dependent quantity bounded
  by the state-action space’s dimension, allows us to conclude that if an MDP is benign,
  then the regret of $\text{ZoRL}$ will be small. The zooming dimension and $\text{ZoRL}$
  are truly adaptive, i.e., the current work shows how to capture adaptivity gains
  for infinite-horizon average-reward RL. $\text{ZoRL}$ outperforms other state-of-the-art
  algorithms in experiments, thereby demonstrating the gains arising due to adaptivity.
