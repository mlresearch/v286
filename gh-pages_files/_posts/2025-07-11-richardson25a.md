title: Learning with Confidence
abstract: 'We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating
  beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on the
  belief state. This *learner’s confidence* can be used alongside (and is easily mistaken
  for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a different concept—one
  that captures many familiar concepts in the literature, including learning rates
  and number of training epochs, Shafer’s weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We
  formally axiomatize what it means to learn with confidence, give two canonical ways
  of measuring confidence on a continuum, and prove that confidence can always be
  represented in this way. Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations
  of confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These
  representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel" observations.
  We characterize *Bayesian* learning as the special case of an optimizing learner
  whose loss representation is a linear expectation.'
