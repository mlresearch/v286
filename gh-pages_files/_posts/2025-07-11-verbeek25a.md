title: Offline Changepoint Detection With Gaussian Processes
abstract: This work proposes Segmenting changepoint Gaussian process regression (SegCPGP),
  an offline changepoint detection method that integrates Gaussian process regression
  with the changepoint kernel, the likelihood ratio test and binary search. We use
  the spectral mixture kernel to detect various types of changes without prior knowledge
  of their type. SegCPGP outperforms state-of-the-art methods when detecting various
  change types in synthetic datasets; in real world changepoint detection datasets,
  it performs on par with its competitors. While its hypothesis test shows slight
  miscalibration, we find SegCPGP remains reasonably reliable.
