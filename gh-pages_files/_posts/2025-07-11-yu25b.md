title: Corruption-Robust Variance-aware Algorithms for Generalized Linear Bandits
  under Heavy-tailed Rewards
abstract: Stochastic linear bandits have recently received significant attention in
  sequential decision-making. However, real-world challenges such as heavy-tailed
  noise, reward corruption, and nonlinear reward functions remain difficult to address.
  To tackle these difficulties, we propose GAdaOFUL, a novel algorithm that leverages
  adaptive Huber regression to achieve robustness in generalized linear models (GLMs),
  where rewards can be nonlinear functions of features. GAdaOFUL achieves a state-of-the-art
  variance-aware regret bound, scaling with the square root of the cumulative reward
  variance over time, plus an additional term proportional to the level of corruption.
  The algorithm adapts to problem complexity, yielding improved regret when the cumulative
  variance is small. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
  of GAdaOFUL in practice. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/NeXAIS/GAdaOFUL}.
