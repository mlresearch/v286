title: Causal Discovery for Linear Non-Gaussian Models with Disjoint Cycles
abstract: The paradigm of linear structural equation modeling readily allows one to
  incorporate causal feedback loops in the model specification. These appear as directed
  cycles in the common graphical representation of the models. However, the presence
  of cycles entails difficulties such as the fact that models need no longer be characterized
  by conditional independence relations. As a result, learning cyclic causal structures
  remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we offer new insights on this problem
  in the context of linear non-Gaussian models. First, we precisely characterize when
  two directed graphs determine the same linear non-Gaussian model. Next, we take
  up a setting of cycle-disjoint graphs, for which we are able to show that simple
  quadratic and cubic polynomial relations among low-order moments of a non-Gaussian
  distribution allow one to locate source cycles. Complementing this with a strategy
  of decorrelating cycles and multivariate regression allows one to infer a block-topological
  order among the directed cycles, which leads to a consistent and computationally
  efficient algorithm for learning causal structures with disjoint cycles.
