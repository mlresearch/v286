title: 'RCAP: Robust, Class-Aware, Probabilistic Dynamic Dataset Pruning'
abstract: 'Dynamic data pruning techniques aim to reduce computational cost while
  minimizing information loss, by periodically selecting representative subsets of
  input data during model training. However, existing methods often struggle to maintain
  strong worst-group accuracy, particularly at high pruning rates, across balanced
  and imbalanced datasets. To address this challenge, we propose RCAP, a Robust, Class-Aware,
  Probabilistic dynamic dataset pruning algorithm for classification tasks. RCAP applies
  a closed-form solution to estimate the fraction of samples to be included in the
  training subset for each individual class. This fraction is adaptively adjusted
  in every epoch using class-wise aggregated loss. Thereafter, it employs an adaptive
  sampling strategy that prioritizes samples having high loss for populating the class-wise
  subsets. We evaluate RCAP on six diverse datasets ranging from class-balanced to
  highly imbalanced using five distinct models across three training paradigms: training
  from scratch, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. Our approach consistently outperforms
  state-of-the-art dataset pruning methods, achieving superior worst-group accuracy
  at all pruning rates. Remarkably, with only $10$% data, RCAP delivers $>1$% improvement
  in performance on class-imbalanced datasets compared to full data training, while
  providing an average $8.69\times$ speedup. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/atif-hassan/RCAP-dynamic-dataset-pruning'
