title: Geodesic Slice Sampler for Multimodal Distributions with Strong Curvature
abstract: Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods often struggle with
  sharp curvatures, intricate geometries, and multimodal distributions. Slice sampling
  can resolve local exploration inefficiency issues, and Riemannian geometries help
  with sharp curvatures. Recent extensions enable slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds,
  but they are restricted to cases where geodesics are available in a closed form.
  We propose a method that generalizes Hit-and-Run slice sampling to more general
  geometries tailored to the target distribution, by approximating geodesics as solutions
  to differential equations. Our approach enables the exploration of the regions with
  strong curvature and rapid transitions between modes in multimodal distributions.
  We demonstrate the advantages of the approach over challenging sampling problems.
