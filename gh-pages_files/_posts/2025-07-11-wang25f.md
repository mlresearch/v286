title: 'MutualNeRF: Improve the Performance of NeRF under Limited Samples with Mutual
  Information Theory'
abstract: This paper introduces MutualNeRF, a framework enhancing Neural Radiance
  Field (NeRF) performance under limited samples using Mutual Information Theory.
  While NeRF excels in 3D scene synthesis, challenges arise with limited data and
  existing methods that aim to introduce prior knowledge lack theoretical support
  in a unified framework. We introduce a simple but theoretically robust concept,
  Mutual Information, as a metric to uniformly measure the correlation between images,
  considering both macro (semantic) and micro (pixel) levels. For sparse view sampling,
  we strategically select additional viewpoints containing more non-overlapping scene
  information by minimizing mutual information without knowing ground truth images
  beforehand. Our framework employs a greedy algorithm, offering a near-optimal solution.
  For few-shot view synthesis, we maximize the mutual information between inferred
  images and ground truth, expecting inferred images to gain more relevant information
  from known images. This is achieved by incorporating efficient, plug-and-play regularization
  terms. Experiments under limited samples show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art
  baselines in different settings, affirming the efficacy of our framework.
