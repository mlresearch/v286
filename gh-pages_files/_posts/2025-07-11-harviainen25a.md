title: Quantum Speedups for Bayesian Network Structure Learning
abstract: The Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL) problem asks for a directed
  acyclic graph that maximizes a given score function. For networks with $n$ nodes,
  the fastest known algorithms run in time $O(2^n n^2)$ in the worst case, with no
  improvement in the asymptotic bound for two decades. Inspired by recent advances
  in quantum computing, we ask whether BNSL admits a polynomial quantum speedup, that
  is, whether the problem can be solved by a quantum algorithm in time $O(c^n)$ for
  some constant $c$ less than $2$. We answer the question in the affirmative by giving
  two algorithms achieving $c \leq 1.817$ and $c \leq 1.982$ assuming the number of
  potential parent sets is, respectively, subexponential and $O(1.453^n)$. Both algorithms
  assume the availability of a quantum random access memory. We also prove that one
  presumably cannot lower the base $2$ for any classical algorithm, as that would
  refute the strong exponential time hypothesis.
