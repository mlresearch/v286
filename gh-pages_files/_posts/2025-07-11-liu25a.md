title: Multi-group Uncertainty Quantification for Long-form Text Generation
abstract: While past works have shown how uncertainty quantification can be applied
  to large language model (LLM) outputs, the question of whether resulting uncertainty
  guarantees still hold within sub-groupings of data remains open. In our work, given
  some long-form text generated by an LLM, we study uncertainty at both the level
  of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and across the
  entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Using biography generation as a
  testbed for this study, we derive a set of (demographic) attributes (e.g., whether
  some text describes a man or woman) for each generation to form such "subgroups"
  of data. We find that although canonical methods for both types of uncertainty quantification
  perform well when measuring across the entire dataset, such guarantees break down
  when examining particular subgroups. Having established this issue, we invoke group-conditional
  methods for uncertainty quantification—multicalibration and multivalid conformal
  prediction—and find that across a variety of approaches, additional subgroup information
  consistently improves calibration and conformal prediction within subgroups (while
  crucially retaining guarantees across the entire dataset). As the problems of calibration,
  conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively
  explored in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these results
  to form a benchmark for this setting.
