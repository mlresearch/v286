title: A Trust-Region Method for Graphical Stein Variational Inference
abstract: Stein variational inference (SVI) is a sample-based approximate Bayesian
  inference technique that generates a sample set by jointly optimizing the samplesâ€™
  locations to minimize an information-theoretic measure of discrepancy with the target
  probability distribution. SVI thus provides a fast and significantly more sample-efficient
  approach to Bayesian inference than traditional (random-sampling-based) alternatives.
  However, the optimization techniques employed in existing SVI methods struggle to
  address problems in which the target distribution is high-dimensional, poorly-conditioned,
  or non-convex, which severely limits the range of their practical applicability.
  In this paper, we propose a novel trust-region optimization approach for SVI that
  successfully addresses each of these challenges. Our method builds upon prior work
  in SVI by leveraging conditional independences in the target distribution (to achieve
  high-dimensional scaling) and second-order information (to address poor conditioning),
  while additionally providing an effective adaptive step control procedure, which
  is essential for ensuring convergence on challenging non-convex optimization problems.
  Experimental results show our method achieves superior numerical performance, both
  in convergence rate and sample accuracy, and scales better in high-dimensional distributions,
  than previous SVI techniques.
