title: Error Bounds for Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Fokker-Planck PDEs
abstract: 'Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution
  of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented
  by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck
  partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve
  the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks
  (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is
  the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to
  construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error
  bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss
  that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear
  PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate
  the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs
  and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions
  compared to the Monte Carlo approach.'
