title: 'Augmenting Online RL with Offline Data is All You Need: A Unified Hybrid RL
  Algorithm Design and Analysis'
abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement learning
  (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and online interactions
  to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm and analysis and show
  that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms with the offline dataset outperforms
  any pure online or offline algorithm alone and achieves state-of-the-art results
  under two learning metrics, i.e., sub-optimality gap and online learning regret.
  Specifically, we show that our algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap $\tilde{O}(
  \sqrt{1/(N_0/ \mathtt{C}(\pi^\star| \rho)+N_1} ) )$, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^\star|\rho)$
  is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$ are the numbers of offline
  and online samples, respectively. For regret minimization, we show that it achieves
  a constant $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up
  compared to pure online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability
  coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an interesting
  separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline dataset for sub-optimality
  gap minimization and regret minimization. We further validate our theoretical findings
  in several experiments in special RL models such as linear contextual bandits and
  Markov decision processes (MDPs).
