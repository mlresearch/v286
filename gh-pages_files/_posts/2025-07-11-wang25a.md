title: A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization
  with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs
abstract: 'Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive
  and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the
  model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure
  typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios.
  Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the
  trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs
  can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we
  propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats
  the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary
  parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this
  problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based
  multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1)
  a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive
  trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and
  2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate
  the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations
  and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively
  identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.'
