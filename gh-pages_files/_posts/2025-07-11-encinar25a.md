title: Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms
abstract: We introduce a class of algorithms, termed proximal interacting particle
  Langevin algorithms (PIPLA), for inference and learning in latent variable models
  whose joint probability density is non-differentiable. Leveraging proximal Markov
  chain Monte Carlo techniques and interacting particle Langevin algorithms, we propose
  three algorithms tailored to the problem of estimating parameters in a non-differentiable
  statistical model. We prove non-asymptotic bounds for the parameter estimates produced
  by the different algorithms in the strongly log-concave setting and provide comprehensive
  numerical experiments on various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed methods. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of our family of algorithms
  for sparse Bayesian logistic regression, training of sparse Bayesian neural networks
  or neural networks with non-differentiable activation functions, image deblurring,
  and sparse matrix completion. Our theory and experiments together show that PIPLA
  family can be the de facto choice for parameter estimation problems in non-differentiable
  latent variable models.
