title: Accurate and Scalable Stochastic Gaussian Process Regression via Learnable
  Coreset-based Variational Inference
abstract: 'We introduce a novel stochastic variational inference method for Gaussian
  process ($\mathcal{GP}$) regression, by deriving a posterior over a learnable set
  of coresets: i.e., over pseudo-input/output, weighted pairs. Unlike former free-form
  variational families for stochastic inference, our coreset-based variational $\mathcal{GP}$
  (CVGP) is defined in terms of the $\mathcal{GP}$ prior and the (weighted) data likelihood.
  This formulation naturally incorporates inductive biases of the prior, and ensures
  its kernel and likelihood dependencies are shared with the posterior. We derive
  a variational lower-bound on the log-marginal likelihood by marginalizing over the
  latent $\mathcal{GP}$ coreset variables, and show that CVGP’s lower-bound is amenable
  to stochastic optimization. CVGP reduces the dimensionality of the variational parameter
  search space to linear $\mathcal{O}(M)$ complexity, while ensuring numerical stability
  at $\mathcal{O}(M^3)$ time complexity and $\mathcal{O}(M^2)$ space complexity. Evaluations
  on real-world and simulated regression problems demonstrate that CVGP achieves superior
  inference and predictive performance than state-of-the-art, stochastic sparse $\mathcal{GP}$
  approximation methods.'
