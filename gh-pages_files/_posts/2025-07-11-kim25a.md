title: 'Collaborative Prediction: To Join or To Disjoin Datasets'
abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need
  of selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
  increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored, even
  for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of developing practical
  algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize population loss of our prediction
  model with high probability. Broadly speaking, we investigate when datasets from
  different sources can be effectively merged to enhance the predictive modelâ€™s performance,
  and propose a practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an
  oracle inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
  with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in both
  standard linear regression and broader deep learning applications.
