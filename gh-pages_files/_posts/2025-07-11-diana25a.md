title: 'Cutting Through Privacy: A Hyperplane-Based Data Reconstruction Attack in
  Federated Learning'
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning
  models across distributed clients without sharing raw data, ostensibly preserving
  data privacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities
  in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate model updates to reconstruct
  clients’ private training data. Existing data reconstruction attacks have important
  limitations: they often rely on assumptions about the clients’ data distribution
  or their efficiency significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens
  of samples. In this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes
  these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully connected
  layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect recovery of arbitrarily
  large data batches in classification tasks without any prior knowledge of clients’
  data. Through extensive experiments on both image and tabular datasets, we demonstrate
  that our attack outperforms existing methods and achieves perfect reconstruction
  of data batches two orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art.'
