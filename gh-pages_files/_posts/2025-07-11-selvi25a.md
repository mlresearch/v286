title: Distributionally and Adversarially Robust Logistic Regression via Intersecting
  Wasserstein Balls
abstract: Adversarially robust optimization (ARO) has emerged as the *de facto* standard
  for training models that hedge against adversarial attacks in the test stage. While
  these models are robust against adversarial attacks, they tend to suffer severely
  from overfitting. To address this issue, some successful methods replace the empirical
  distribution in the training stage with alternatives including *(i)* a worst-case
  distribution residing in an ambiguity set, resulting in a distributionally robust
  (DR) counterpart of ARO; *(ii)* a mixture of the empirical distribution with a distribution
  induced by an auxiliary (*e.g.*, synthetic, external, out-of-domain) dataset. Inspired
  by the former, we study the Wasserstein DR counterpart of ARO for logistic regression
  and show it admits a tractable convex optimization reformulation. Adopting the latter
  setting, we revise the DR approach by intersecting its ambiguity set with another
  ambiguity set built using the auxiliary dataset, which offers a significant improvement
  whenever the Wasserstein distance between the data generating and auxiliary distributions
  can be estimated. We study the underlying optimization problem, develop efficient
  solution algorithms, and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark
  approaches on standard datasets.
