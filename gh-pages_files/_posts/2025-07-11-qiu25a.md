title: Enhanced Equilibria-Solving via Private Information Pre-Branch Structure in
  Adversarial Team Games
abstract: In ex ante coordinated adversarial team games (ATGs), a team competes against
  an adversary, and team members can only coordinate their strategies before the game
  starts. The team-maxmin equilibrium with correlation (TMECor) is a suitable solution
  concept for extensive-form sequential ATGs. One class of TMECor-solving methods
  transforms the problem into solving NE in two-player zero-sum games, leveraging
  well-established tools for the latter. However, existing methods are fundamentally
  action-based, resulting in poor generalizability and low solving efficiency due
  to the exponential growth in the size of the transformed game. To address the above
  issues, we propose an efficient game transformation method based on private information,
  where all team members are represented by a single coordinator. We designed a structure
  called private information pre-branch, which makes decisions considering all possible
  private information from teammates. We prove that the size of the game transformed
  by our method is exponentially reduced compared to the current state-of-the-art.
  Moreover, we demonstrate equilibria equivalence. Experimentally, our method achieves
  a significant speedup of 182.89$\times$ to 694.44$\times$ in scenarios where the
  current state-of-the-art method can work, such as small-scale Kuhn poker and Leduc
  poker. Furthermore, our method is applicable to larger games and those with dynamically
  changing private information, such as Goofspiel.
