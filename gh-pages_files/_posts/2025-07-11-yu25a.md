title: How Likely Are Two Voting Rules Different?
abstract: We characterize the maximum likelihood that two voting rule outcomes are
  different and that the winner of one voting rule is the loser of another (implying
  that they are {\em drastically different}) on positional scoring rules, Condorcet
  winner/loser, Copeland, Ranked Pairs, and STV (Single Transferable Vote) under any
  fixed number of alternatives. The most famous problem in this scope is strong Borda’s
  paradox, in which the winner of the plurality rule is the Condorcet loser. Under
  mild assumptions, we show that the maximum likelihood that different rules are drastically
  different is $\Theta(1)$ except for a few special cases, demonstrating the difference
  between these rules. We also prove that two scoring rules with linear independent
  scoring vectors have different winners with probability $\Theta(1)$, no matter how
  similar they are. Our analysis adopts the {\em smoothed social choice framework} \cite{xia2020smoothed}
  and can be applied to a variety of statistical models, including the standard impartial
  culture (IC).
