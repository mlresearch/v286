title: Nonlinear Causal Discovery for Grouped Data
abstract: 'Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
  significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar random
  variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience, psychology, social
  science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of interest are groups of
  variables rather than individual scalar measurements. Motivated by these applications,
  we extend nonlinear additive noise models to handle random vectors, establishing
  a two-step approach for causal graph learning: First, infer the causal order among
  random vectors. Second, perform model selection to identify the best graph consistent
  with this order. We introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the
  vector case, demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply
  our method to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
  among variable groups.'
