title: Temperature Optimization for Bayesian Deep Learning
abstract: 'The Cold Posterior Effect (CPE) is a phenomenon in Bayesian Deep Learning
  (BDL), where tempering the posterior to a cold temperature often improves the predictive
  performance of the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). Although the term ‘CPE’
  suggests colder temperatures are inherently better, the BDL community increasingly
  recognizes that this is not always the case. Despite this, there remains no systematic
  method for finding the optimal temperature beyond grid search. In this work, we
  propose a data-driven approach to select the temperature that maximizes test log-predictive
  density, treating the temperature as a model parameter and estimating it directly
  from the data. We empirically demonstrate that our method performs comparably to
  grid search, at a fraction of the cost, across both regression and classification
  tasks. Finally, we highlight the differing perspectives on CPE between the BDL and
  Generalized Bayes communities: while the former primarily emphasizes the predictive
  performance of the PPD, the latter prioritizes the utility of the posterior under
  model misspecification; these distinct objectives lead to different temperature
  preferences.'
