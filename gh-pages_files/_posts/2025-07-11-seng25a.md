title: Scaling Probabilistic Circuits via Data Partitioning
abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) enable us to learn joint distributions over
  a set of random variables and to perform various probabilistic queries in a tractable
  fashion. Though the tractability property allows PCs to scale beyond non-tractable
  models such as Bayesian Networks, scaling training and inference of PCs to larger,
  real-world datasets remains challenging. To remedy the situation, we show how PCs
  can be learned across multiple machines by recursively partitioning a distributed
  dataset, thereby unveiling a deep connection between PCs and federated learning
  (FL). This leads to federated circuits (FCs)—a novel and flexible federated learning
  (FL) framework that (1) allows one to scale PCs on distributed learning environments
  (2) train PCs faster and (3) unifies for the first time horizontal, vertical, and
  hybrid FL in one framework by re-framing FL as a density estimation problem over
  distributed datasets. We demonstrate FC’s capability to scale PCs on various large-scale
  datasets. Also, we show FC’s versatility in handling horizontal, vertical, and hybrid
  FL within a unified framework on multiple classification tasks.
