title: Valid Bootstraps for Network Embeddings with Applications to Network Visualisation
abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in networks is an important step in modelling relationships
  and interactions between entities. We consider the challenge of bootstrapping an
  inhomogeneous random graph when only a single observation of the network is made
  and the underlying data generating function is unknown. We address this problem
  by considering embeddings of the observed and bootstrapped network that are statistically
  indistinguishable. We utilise an exchangeable network test that can empirically
  validate bootstrap samples generated by any method. Existing methods fail this test,
  so we propose a principled, distribution-free network bootstrap using k-nearest
  neighbour smoothing, that can pass this exchangeable network test in many synthetic
  and real-data scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of this work in combination
  with the popular data visualisation method t-SNE, where uncertainty estimates from
  bootstrapping are used to explain whether visible structures represent real statistically
  sound structures.
