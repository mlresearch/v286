title: 'Coevolutionary Emergent Systems Optimization with Applications to Ultra-High-Dimensional
  Metasurface Design : OAM Wave Manipulation'
abstract: Optimization problems in electromagnetic wave manipulation and metasurface
  design are becoming increasingly high-dimensional, often involving thousands of
  variables that need precise control. Traditional optimization algorithms face significant
  challenges in maintaining both accuracy and computational efficiency when dealing
  with such ultra-high-dimensional problems. This paper presents a novel Coevolutionary
  Emergent Systems Optimization (CESO) algorithm that integrates coevolutionary dynamics,
  emergent behavior, and adaptive mechanisms to address these challenges. CESO features
  a unique multi-subsystem architecture that enables parallel exploration of solution
  spaces while maintaining interactive influences between subsystems. The algorithm
  incorporates an efficient adaptive mechanism for parameter adjustment and a distinctive
  emergent behavior simulation mechanism that prevents local optima traps through
  periodic subsystem reorganization. Experimental results on the CEC2017 benchmark
  suite demonstrate CESO’s superior performance. The algorithm’s practical effectiveness
  is validated through a challenging application in electromagnetic wave manipulation
  - OAM wave demultiplexing system (10,000 dimensions). In this application, CESO
  achieves superior mode separation for OAM wave demultiplexing compared to traditional
  algorithms. These results demonstrate CESO’s significant advantages in solving practical
  high-dimensional optimization problems.
