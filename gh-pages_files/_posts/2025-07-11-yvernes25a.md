title: Complete Characterization for Adjustment in Summary Causal Graphs of Time Series
abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether
  the total causal effect can be written with a do-free formula, and thus be estimated
  from observational data only. We study this problem, considering multiple interventions,
  in the context of time series when only an abstraction of the true causal graph,
  in the form of a summary causal graph, is available. We propose in particular both
  necessary and sufficient conditions for the adjustment criterion, which we show
  is complete in this setting, and provide a pseudo-linear algorithm to decide whether
  the query is identifiable or not.
