title: Improving Adversarial Transferability via Decision Boundary Adaptation
abstract: Black-box attacks play a pivotal role in adversarial attacks. However, existing
  approaches often focus predominantly on attacking from a data-centric perspective,
  neglecting crucial aspects of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel
  approach in this paper, coined Decision Boundary Adaptation (DBA). Our approach
  innovatively adopts a model-centric viewpoint, leveraging operations on the model
  to attain properties that enhance transferability. We observe that a flatter curvature
  of the statistical manifold, influenced by both samples and model parameters, leads
  to stronger transferability of the adversarial attacks. To leverage this, we introduce
  the concept of local flatness, providing an evaluation method for local flatness
  property along with a detailed mathematical proof. Additionally, we demonstrate
  a consistent relationship between local flatness, the modelâ€™s decision boundary,
  and the gradient descent process, showing how flatness can be achieved through gradient
  descent at the model parameter level. Through extensive evaluation using state-of-the-art
  adversarial attack techniques, our DBA approach significantly enhances the black-box
  attack capabilities of all the tested adversarial attack methods. The implementation
  of our method is available at https://github.com/LMBTough/DBA.
