title: Asymptotically Optimal Linear Best Feasible Arm Identification with Fixed Budget
abstract: 'The challenge of identifying the optimal feasible arm within a fixed budget
  has attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains
  in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability approaches
  zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple setting of $K$-armed
  bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address this gap by examining the
  problem within the context of linear bandits. We introduce a novel algorithm for
  best feasible arm identification that guarantees an exponential decay in the error
  probability. Remarkably, the decay rate-characterized by the exponent-matches the
  theoretical lower bound derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach
  leverages a posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule
  involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations
  with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the identification
  process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness
  of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations across various problem
  instances with different levels of complexity. The results corroborate our theoretical
  findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms several benchmark algorithms
  in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.'
