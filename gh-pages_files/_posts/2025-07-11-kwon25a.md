title: Adaptive Reward Design for Reinforcement Learning
abstract: There is a surge of interest in using formal languages such as Linear Temporal
  Logic (LTL) to precisely and succinctly specify complex tasks and derive reward
  functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing methods often assign
  sparse rewards (e.g., giving a reward of 1 only if a task is completed and 0 otherwise).
  By providing feedback solely upon task completion, these methods fail to encourage
  successful subtask completion. This is particularly problematic in environments
  with inherent uncertainty, where task completion may be unreliable despite progress
  on intermediate goals. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of reward
  functions that incentivize an RL agent to complete a task specified by an LTL formula
  as much as possible, and develop an adaptive reward shaping approach that dynamically
  updates reward functions during the learning process. Experimental results on a
  range of benchmark RL environments demonstrate that the proposed approach generally
  outperforms baselines, achieving earlier convergence to a better policy with higher
  expected return and task completion rate.
