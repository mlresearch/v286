title: Aggregating Data for Optimal Learning
abstract: Multiple Instance Regression (MIR) and Learning from Label Proportions (LLP)
  are useful learning frameworks, where the training data is partitioned into disjoint
  sets or bags, and only an aggregate label, i.e., bag-label for each bag is available
  to the learner. In the case of MIR, the bag-label is the label of an undisclosed
  instance from the bag, while in LLP, the bag-label is the mean of the bagâ€™s labels.
  In this paper, we study for various loss functions in MIR and LLP, what is the optimal
  way to partition the dataset into bags such that the utility for downstream tasks
  like linear regression is maximized. We theoretically provide utility guarantees,
  and show that in each case, the optimal bagging strategy (approximately) reduces
  to finding an optimal clustering of the feature vectors and/or the labels with respect
  to natural objectives such as $k$-means. We also show that our bagging mechanisms
  can be made label-differentially private, incurring an additional utility error.
  We then generalize our results to the setting of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).
  Finally, we experimentally validate our theoretical results.
