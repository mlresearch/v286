title: Fast Calculation of Feature Contributions in Boosting Trees
abstract: Recently, several fast algorithms have been proposed to decompose predicted
  value into Shapley values, enabling individualized feature contribution analysis
  in tree models. While such local decomposition offers valuable insights, it underscores
  the need for a global evaluation of feature contributions. Although coefficients
  of determination ($R^2$) allow for comparative assessment of individual features,
  individualizing $R^2$ is challenged by the underlying quadratic losses. To address
  this, we propose Q-SHAP, an efficient algorithm that reduces the computational complexity
  of calculating Shapley values for quadratic losses to polynomial time. Our extensive
  simulations show that Q-SHAP not only improves computational efficiency but also
  enhances the accuracy of feature-specific $R^2$ estimates.
