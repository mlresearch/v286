title: Multi-Cost-Bounded Reachability Analysis of POMDPs
abstract: We consider multi-dimensional cost-bounded reachability probability objectives
  for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The goal is to compute
  the maximal probability to reach a set of target states while simultaneously satisfying
  specified bounds on incurred costs. Such objectives generalise well-studied POMDP
  objectives by allowing multiple upper and lower bounds on different cost or reward
  measures, e.g. to naturally model scenarios where an agent acts under limited resources.
  We present a reduction of the multi-cost-bounded problem to unbounded reachability
  probabilities on an unfolding of the original POMDP. We employ a refined approach
  in case the agent is cost-aware-i.e., collected costs are fully observed-and also
  consider a setting where only partial information about the collected costs is known.
  Our approaches elegantly lift existing results from the fully observable MDP case
  to POMDPs. An empirical evaluation shows the potential of analysing POMDPs under
  multi-cost-bounded reachability objectives in practical settings.
