title: Selective Blocking for Message-Passing Neural Networks on Heterophilic Graphs
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) thrive on message passing (MP) but are vulnerable
  when the graph carries many heterophilic or misclassified edges. Prior analyses
  suggest that signed propagation can mitigate over-smoothing under low edge-error
  rates, yet they implicitly assume perfect edge labels and the presence of self-loops.
  We revisit this setting and show that, under high edge uncertainty, propagating
  any information may harm node separability even with signed weights. Our key insight
  is to decide not to propagate along uncertain edges adaptively. Concretely, we intentionally
  omit self-loops to isolate pure neighbor influence for a clearer theoretical analysis,
  adopt a row-stochastic (asymmetric) operator that matches the Markov-chain view
  of MP and simplifies spectral-radius proofs, and dynamically estimate the local
  homophily $b_i$ and edge-classification error $e_t$ during training via an EM procedure.
  We prove that our selective blocking yields a sub-stochastic propagation matrix
  whose joint spectral radius exceeds that of signed GNNs under high $e_t$, guaranteeing
  reduced over-smoothing, and we supply a lemma showing that class-discriminative
  signals survive even when the operator is rank-deficient. Extensive experiments
  on seven homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks confirm that the proposed adaptive
  blocking outperforms strong baselines.
