title: Concept Forgetting via Label Annealing
abstract: The effectiveness of current machine learning models relies on their ability
  to grasp diverse concepts present in datasets. However, biased and noisy data can
  inadvertently cause these models to learn certain undesired concepts, undermining
  their ability to generalize and provide utility. Consequently, modifying a trained
  model to forget these concepts becomes imperative for their responsible deployment.
  We refer to this problem as *concept forgetting*. Our goal is to develop techniques
  for forgetting specific undesired concepts from a pre-trained classification modelâ€™s
  prediction. To achieve this goal, we present an algorithm called **L**abel **AN**nealing
  (**LAN**). This iterative algorithm employs a two-stage method for each iteration.
  In the first stage, pseudo-labels are assigned to all the samples by annealing or
  redistributing the original labels based on the predictions of the model in the
  current iteration. During the second stage, the model is fine-tuned on this pseudo-labeled
  dataset generated from the first stage. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  algorithms across various models and datasets. Our method reduces *concept violation*,
  a metric that measures how much the model forgets specific concepts, by about 85.35%
  on the MNIST dataset, 73.25% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and 69.46% on the CelebA dataset
  while maintaining high model accuracy.
