title: Black-box Optimization with Unknown Constraints via Overparameterized Deep
  Neural Networks
abstract: Optimizing expensive black-box functions under unknown constraints is a
  fundamental challenge across a range of real-world domains, such as hyperparameter
  tuning in machine learning, safe control in robotics, and material or drug discovery.
  In these settings, each function evaluation may be costly or time-consuming, and
  the system may need to operate within unknown or difficult-to-specify safety boundaries.
  We apply the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function to select the next samples
  within a feasible region, determined by Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) conditions
  for all constraints. The LCB approach guarantees constraint feasibility, while EI
  efficiently balances exploration and exploitation, especially when the feasible
  regions are much smaller than the overall search space. To model both the objective
  function and constraints, we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) instead of Gaussian
  Processes (GPs) to improve scalability and handle complex structured data. We provide
  a theoretical analysis showing our methodâ€™s convergence using recent Neural Tangent
  Kernel (NTK) theory. Under regularity conditions, both cumulative regret and constraint
  violation are bounded by the maximum information gain, with equivalent upper bounds
  to GP-based methods. To validate our algorithm, we conduct experiments on synthetic
  and real-world benchmarks, showing its benefit over recent methods in black-box
  optimization with unknown constraints.
