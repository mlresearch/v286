title: Multi-Label Bayesian Active Learning with Inter-Label Relationships
abstract: The primary challenge of multi-label active learning, differing it from
  multi-class active learning, lies in assessing the informativeness of an indefinite
  number of labels while also accounting for the inherited label correlation. Existing
  studies either require substantial computational resources to leverage correlations
  or fail to fully explore label dependencies. Additionally, real-world scenarios
  often require addressing intrinsic biases stemming from imbalanced data distributions.
  In this paper, we propose a new multi-label active learning strategy to address
  both challenges. Our method incorporates progressively updated positive and negative
  correlation matrices to capture co-occurrence and disjoint relationships within
  the label space of annotated samples, enabling a holistic assessment of uncertainty
  rather than treating labels as isolated elements. Furthermore, alongside diversity,
  our model employs ensemble pseudo labeling and beta scoring rules to address data
  imbalances. Extensive experiments on four realistic datasets demonstrate that our
  strategy consistently achieves more reliable and superior performance, compared
  to several established methods.
