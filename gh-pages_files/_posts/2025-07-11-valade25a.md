title: 'EERO: Early Exit with Reject Option for Efficient Classification with limited
  budget'
abstract: The increasing complexity of advanced machine learning models requires innovative
  approaches to manage computational resources effectively. One such method is the
  Early Exit strategy, which allows for adaptive computation by providing a mechanism
  to shorten the processing path for simpler data instances. In this paper, we propose
  EERO, a new methodology to translate the problem of early exiting to a problem of
  using multiple classifiers with reject option in order to better select the exiting
  head for each instance. We calibrate the probabilities of exiting at the different
  heads using aggregation with exponential weights to guarantee a fixed budget. We
  consider factors such as Bayesian risk, budget constraints, and head-specific budget
  consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
  compromise between budget allocation and accuracy.
