title: Guiding Time-Varying Generative Models with Natural Gradients on Exponential
  Family Manifold
abstract: Optimising probabilistic models is a well-studied field in statistics. However,
  its connection with the training of generative models remains largely under-explored.
  In this paper, we show that the evolution of time-varying generative models can
  be projected onto an exponential family manifold, naturally creating a link between
  the parameters of a generative model and those of a probabilistic model. We then
  train the generative model by moving its projection on the manifold according to
  the natural gradient descent scheme. This approach also allows us to efficiently
  approximate the natural gradient of the KL divergence without relying on MCMC for
  intractable models. Furthermore, we propose particle versions of the algorithm,
  which feature closed-form update rules for any parametric model within the exponential
  family. Through toy and real-world experiments, we validate the effectiveness of
  the proposed algorithms. The code of the proposed algorithms can be found at \url{https://github.com/anewgithubname/iNGD}.
