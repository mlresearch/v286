title: 'Revisiting the Berkeley Admissions data: Statistical Tests for Causal Hypotheses'
abstract: Reasoning about fairness through correlation-based notions is rife with
  pitfalls. The 1973 University of California, Berkeley graduate school admissions
  case from \citet{BickelHO75} is a classic example of one such pitfall, namely Simpson’s
  paradox. The discrepancy in admission rates among male and female applicants, in
  the aggregate data over all departments, vanishes when admission rates per department
  are examined. We reason about the Berkeley graduate school admissions case through
  a causal lens. In the process, we introduce a statistical test for causal hypothesis
  testing based on Pearl’s instrumental-variable inequalities \citep{Pearl95}. We
  compare different causal notions of fairness that are based on graphical, counterfactual
  and interventional queries on the causal model, and develop statistical tests for
  these notions that use only observational data. We study the logical relations between
  notions, and show that while notions may not be equivalent, their corresponding
  statistical tests coincide for the case at hand. We believe that a thorough case-based
  causal analysis helps develop a more principled understanding of both causal hypothesis
  testing and fairness.
