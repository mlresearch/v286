title: Enumerating Optimal Cost-Constrained Adjustment Sets
abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is a key problem in causal
  inference, often addressed through covariate adjustment sets that enable unbiased
  estimation of interventional means. This paper tackles the challenge of finding
  optimal covariate adjustment sets under budget constraints, a practical concern
  in many applications. We present algorithms for enumerating valid and minimal adjustment
  sets up to a specified cost, ordered by their proximity to outcome variables, which
  coincides with estimator variance. Our approach builds on existing graphical criteria
  and extends them to accommodate budgetary considerations, providing a useful tool
  for addressing resource limitations.
