title: Dependent Randomized Rounding for Budget Constrained Experimental Design
abstract: Policymakers in resource-constrained settings require experimental designs
  that satisfy strict budget limits while ensuring precise estimation of treatment
  effects. We propose a framework that applies a dependent randomized rounding procedure
  to convert assignment probabilities into binary treatment decisions. Our proposed
  solution preserves the marginal treatment probabilities while inducing negative
  correlations among assignments, leading to improved estimator precision through
  variance reduction. We establish theoretical guarantees for the inverse propensity
  weighted and general linear estimators, and demonstrate through empirical studies
  that our approach yields efficient and accurate inference under fixed budget constraints.
