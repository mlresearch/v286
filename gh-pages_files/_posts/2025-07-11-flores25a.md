title: Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using
  Error Bounds and Solution Bundles
abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain
  solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As PINNs
  are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some
  work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing
  with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural
  Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation
  systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate
  a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore,
  we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter
  estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.
