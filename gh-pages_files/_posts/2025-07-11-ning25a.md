title: 'i$^2$VAE: Interest Information Augmentation with Variational Regularizers
  for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation'
abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across
  multiple domains to mitigate data sparsity and cold-start challenges in Single-Domain
  Sequential Recommendation. Existing methods primarily rely on shared users (overlapping
  users) to learn transferable interest representations. However, these approaches
  have limited information propagation, benefiting mainly overlapping users and those
  with rich interaction histories while neglecting non-overlapping (cold-start) and
  long-tailed users, who constitute the majority in real-world scenarios. To address
  this issue, we propose i$^2$VAE, a novel variational autoencoder (VAE)-based framework
  that enhances user interest learning with mutual information-based regularizers.
  i$^2$VAE improves recommendations for cold-start and long-tailed users while maintaining
  strong performance across all user groups. Specifically, cross-domain and disentangling
  regularizers extract transferable features for cold-start users, while a pseudo-sequence
  generator synthesizes interactions for long-tailed users, refined by a denoising
  regularizer to filter noise and preserve meaningful interest signals. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that i$^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring
  its effectiveness in real-world CDSR applications. Code and datasets are available
  at https://github.com/WujiangXu/IM-VAE.
