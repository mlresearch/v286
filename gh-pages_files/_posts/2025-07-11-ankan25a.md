title: 'Expert-In-The-Loop Causal Discovery: Iterative Model Refinement Using Expert
  Knowledge'
abstract: Many researchers construct directed acyclic graph (DAG) models manually
  based on domain knowledge. Although numerous causal discovery algorithms were developed
  to automatically learn DAGs and other causal models from data, these remain challenging
  to use due to their tendency to produce results that contradict domain knowledge,
  among other issues. Here we propose a hybrid, iterative structure learning approach
  that combines domain knowledge with data-driven insights to assist researchers in
  constructing DAGs. Our method leverages conditional independence testing to iteratively
  identify variable pairs where an edge is either missing or superfluous. Based on
  this information, we can choose to add missing edges with appropriate orientation
  based on domain knowledge or remove unnecessary ones. We also give a method to rank
  these missing edges based on their impact on the overall model fit. In a simulation
  study, we find that this iterative approach to leverage domain knowledge already
  starts outperforming purely data-driven structure learning if the orientation of
  new edge is correctly determined in at least two out of three cases. We present
  a proof-of-concept implementation using a large language model as a domain expert
  and a graphical user interface designed to assist human experts with DAG construction.
