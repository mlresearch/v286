title: Exploring Exploration in Bayesian Optimization
abstract: A well-balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for successful
  acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization. However, there is a lack of quantitative
  measures for exploration, making it difficult to analyze and compare different acquisition
  functions. This work introduces two novel approaches -observation traveling salesman
  distance and observation entropy- to quantify the exploration characteristics of
  acquisition functions based on their selected observations. Using these measures,
  we examine the explorative nature of several well-known acquisition functions across
  a diverse set of black-box problems, uncover links between exploration and empirical
  performance, and reveal new relationships among existing acquisition functions.
  Beyond enabling a deeper understanding of acquisition functions, these measures
  also provide a foundation for guiding their design in a more principled and systematic
  manner.
