title: Online Learning with Stochastically Partitioning Experts
abstract: We study a variant of the experts problem in which new experts are revealed
  over time according to a stochastic process. The experts are represented by partitions
  of a hypercube $\mathbb{B}$ in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. In each round, a
  point is drawn from $\mathbb{B}$ in an independent and identically distributed manner
  using an unknown distribution. For each chosen point, we draw $d$ orthogonal hyperplanes
  parallel to the $d$ faces of $\mathbb{B}$ passing through the point. The set of
  experts available in a round is the set of partitions of $\mathbb{B}$ created by
  all the hyperplanes drawn up to that point. Losses are adversarial, and the performance
  metrics of interest include expected regret and high probability bounds on the sample-path
  regret. We propose a suitably adapted version of the Hedge algorithm called Hedge-G,
  which uses a constant learning rate and has $O(\sqrt{2^d T \log T})$ expected regret,
  which is order-optimal. Further, we show that for Hedge-G, there exists a trade-off
  between choosing a learning rate that has optimal expected regret and a learning
  rate that leads to a high probability sample-path regret bound. We address this
  limitation by proposing AdaHedge-G, a variant of Hedge-G that uses an adaptive learning
  rate by tracking the loss of the experts revealed up to that round. AdaHedge-G simultaneously
  achieves $O(\log(\log T)\sqrt{ T \log T})$ expected regret and $O(\log T \sqrt{T
  \log T})$ sample-path regret, with probability at least $1-T^{-c}$, where $c > 0$
  is a constant dependent on $d$.
